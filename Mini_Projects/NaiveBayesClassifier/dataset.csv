"Day/night cricket, also known as floodlit cricket, is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under floodlights in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) , attracting large crowds to see some of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.Floodlit first-class cricket was first played in 1994, when the concept was tried during the Sheffield Shield.[1] Day/night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]In October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.[2] The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015, 36 years to the day from the first ICC sanctioned day night match.[3]It is believed that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to ""Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise."" The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: ""What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?""[4]It appeared that the cricketing world concurred with The Times that playing cricket under floodlights was not a viable concept, and for over twenty years Jack Young's benefit remained a one-off. However, in 1977, when Kerry Packer bought over 50 of the world's leading cricketers to play in his World Series Cricket, the concept came to the fore.[5] After initial attendances at the matches were low, Packer moved from so called ""Supertests"" to one-day cricket, generally played under floodlights. Attendances of roughly 2,000 had attended the ""Supertests"" between Australia and the West Indies at the Australian rules football stadium, VFL Park in Melbourne in November 1977. A year later – almost to the day, 44,377 people were inside the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a floodlit one-day match between the same sides. Opposition to World Series Cricket was large, and the matches did not have Test cricket nor first-class cricket status. In 1979 an agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer brought World Series Cricket to an end.[5] The marketing potential of floodlit cricket had been noticed though, and the first floodlit One Day International was contested in November 1979 between the official cricket teams of Australia and the West Indies.[6]Floodlit cricket was soon taking place not only in Australia, but also in South Africa, the West Indies and the subcontinent. In England, opposition remained firm; not only was there lingering hostility towards Packer's World Series Cricket, but the differences in climate make the application difficult. In contrast to Australia and South Africa, where twilight is minimal, and the light fades quickly, the long English evenings meant that the floodlights would only be required for the last hour or so of a match. The increased chance of rain also meant that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was loath to spend money on permanent lights, when rain would stop play anyway.[7]Day/Night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]During the late 2000s, discussions regarding the possibility of playing day/night Test matches occurred. In the West Indies, the first floodlit first-class cricket match in which the teams used a pink ball, was played between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago[8] The viability of using a pink ball was also tried out by Cricket Australia and some Indian Premier League and Bangladesh Cricket League franchises.[9] The annual curtain-raiser to the English cricket season in 2010 was played under floodlights in Abu Dhabi, with a mixed but generally positive reception.[10] A year later, in 2011, the first County Championship game to be played under lights was played, between Kent and Glamorgan at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.[11]The field Shield [[The oournsj\ hud FFJUSUHS; 
] included three-day/night first-class matches with pink balls.[12] The trials continued in 2014–15 as Cricket Australia looked to host the first day-night Test in 2015 against New Zealand.[13] This match took place at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015.[3]India's first pink ball match took place in Kolkata on 18 July 2016. It was CAB Super League Final between Bhowanipore Club and Mohan Bagan.[citation needed] Mohan Bagan won the match by 296 runs. The 2016 Duleep Trophy matches were played under the lights in Greater Noida. Feedback about the ball was that due to the brightness of the ball, the team handling the camera was able to track the pink ball better than the red. However, catching the ball in the deep during day-light was relatively difficult compared to the red ball.[14] In September 2016, the BCCI confirmed that there would be no day/night Tests in India during the 2016–17 season.[15] Incidentally, the first day-night first-class match in India was held much earlier: in April 1997, the Ranji trophy final between Delhi and Mumbai was played at Gwalior under lights. A pink ball was not used, with play carried for five days using a white ball.The second day/night Test took place between Pakistan and the West Indies on 13–17 October 2016.[16] In October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test between England and the West Indies in August 2017 would be played as a day/night game.[17]Australia played two day/night Tests in their home summer of 2016/17: one against South Africa at Adelaide and one against Pakistan at Brisbane.On 7 March 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed that the first ever day/night women's Test would be played between Australia and England. This was the sole Test of the 2017–18 Women's Ashes series and was played at the North Sydney Oval.[18]",Sports,1

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia are gearing up to play their 1st ever pink-ball Test at Eden Gardens Kolkata from November 22. Bangladesh will be their opposition in the much-anticipated clash that comes after India thrashed the tourists by an innings and 130 in the 1st of the ongoing 2-match Test series.The 1st ever day-night Test was played between Australia and New Zealand in 2015 and 11 pink-ball Tests have been played since but India had stayed away from the experimental format until Sourav Ganguly took over as Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president.India had said no to Australia and West Indies in the past when they came forward to host India in day-night Tests. Also, India also missed out on a chance to host in the 2016-17 season.Over the years, the Indian team management had cited lack of pink-ball exposure for their inhibition to play day-night Tests. However, Sourav Ganguly said Virat Kohli readily agreed to his request to play the upcoming pink-ball Test against Bangladesh.In India, there are only a handful of pink-ball matches that have been played so far. Duleep Trophy, India's 4-day cricket tournament, was played with the pink ball for three seasons. The 1st ever pink-ball cricket match played in India was the Cricket Association of Bengal Super League Final played at the Eden Gardens in 2016.Here's a look at how India cricketers have fared in pink-ball cricketFirstly, captain Virat Kohli has no competitive pink-ball experience. Vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and pacer Umesh Yadav also have no pink-ball exposure. Shubman Gill completes the group of 5 players which has zero competitive pink-ball experience in the India squad.Rohit SharmaRohit Sharma played the final of Duleep Trophy 2016 -- the first edition of the tournament that was played with the pink ball. Rohit scored 30 and 32 for India Blue in their massive 355-run win over India Red at Greater Noida.Mayank AgarwalIn-form opener Mayank Agarwal was the star of India's 1st experiment with the pink ball. Mayank scored 161 for India Blue and shone in the final as well with 2 half-centuries.Mayank amassed a total of 419 runs from 5 innings with scores of 92, 161, 58, 57, 52 -- not a single score less than fifty in pink-ball cricket. He is certainly the one to watch out for in India's inaugural pink-ball Test.Cheteshwar PujaraPujara, as expected, found success in the pink-ball format as well. Pujara scored 2 daddy hundreds. His score of 256 helped India Blue win the Duleep Trophy in 2016. It is also the highest score in pink-ball cricket by an India batsman.Pujara ended the 2016 Duleep Trophy season with scores of 166, 31, 256.Virat KohliHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Ajinkya RahaneHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Wriddhiman SahaEven though Wriddhiman Saha was not part of pink-ball Duleep Trophy matches, the wicketkeeper-batsman took part in the historic CAB Super League final.Playing for Mohun Bagan Bhowanipore, Saha scored 33 in the 1st innings but was dismissed for 0 in the second.Ravindra JadejaRavindra Jadeja was also part of the 2016 Duleep Trophy season. He shone with two 5-wicket hauls with the pink ball in the final for India Blue. Jadeja also chipped in with the bat scoring 48 and 17 in the season. It was a dream outing for the India spinner who finished the match with figures of 171/10.R AshwinHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Umesh YadavHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Mohammed ShamiLike his Bengal teammate Wriddhiman Saha, Mohammed Shami was also part of the historic CAB Super League final. Shami was at the top of his game in the pink-ball match and was nearly unplayable under lights. He took a 5-wicket haul and was declared the Man of the Match of the CAB Super League final.Shami shone with figures of 5/42, 2/82 for Mohun Bagan and hit 27 from 16 balls as well.Ishant SharmaPacer Ishant Sharma played 1 match in Duleep Trophy 2017 and managed to pick up a wicket. He also chipped in with the bat, scoring 9 runs for India Blue in Kanpur.Apart from them, Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant and Hanuma Vihari also have competitive pink-ball experience.Kuldeep shone in the 2016 Duleep Trophy, picking up 11 wickets while Hanuma Vihari scored 105 in the only Duleep Trophy pink-ball match he featured in 2017.Rishabh Pant, who is in the India squad, managed scores of 11, 15 and 46 in Duleep Trophy 2017.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe BCCI President Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday said that the tickets for the first four days of India's first Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata have been sold out and he was extremely happy about it.India play their first Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata from November 22 and both the teams have reached the eastern megapolis.""It's sold out and I'm extremely happy (about it),"" said Ganguly here after visiting the BCCI headquarters.Asked for how many days it was sold out, Ganguly informed four. The countdown of the historic Test began in Kolkata on Sunday with the City of Joy turning pink.Earlier, Ganguly had unveiled 'Pinku-Tinku', the event's official mascots. The Eden Gardens, one of the biggest stadiums in India, has a capacity of 67,000.The historic match will kickstart with Army paratroopers flying into the Eden Gardens to hand over a pink ball each to the two captains just before the toss.This will be followed by the ringing of the customary Eden Bell by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Then at the 20-minute tea break, former captains and the galaxy of sport stars from other disciplines will be taken out on carts making a round of the ground along the boundary lines.During the 40-minute supper break, CAB has organised a talk show featuring the 'Fabulous Five' of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and VVS Laxman who will walk down the memory lane, delving on the epic 2001 Test win against Australia here.The CAB will also felicitate a galaxy of Indian sports stars including Tendulkar, Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra, tennis star Sania Mirza, world badminton champion PV Sindhu and six-time boxing world champion MC Mary Kom among others.Specially designed mementos will be given to the dignitaries while they will also make round of the stadium aboard golf carts, CAB secretary Avishek Dalmiya said.The CAB will also felicitate the team members of Bangladesh-India first-ever Test in 2000, a game where Ganguly made his debut as Test captain.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia is barely days away from its first ever pink ball Test match. On November 22, Virat Kohli's India will take on Bangladesh in a historic Day-night Test with many dignitaries from several fields set to be in attendance.In 2018, BCCI had turned down an offer to play a Day-night Test in Australia. For the record, 11 Day-night Tests have been played so far and Australia are the most dominant team with 5 wins in 5 matches.So what is so different about the Day-night Tests? For starters, obviously a certain part of the day's proceedings will be played under lights. Unlike the traditional start time of 9.30 AM for Test matches in India, play will start at 1 PM.Moreover, pink balls will be used in place of red balls for better visibility under lights.As the historic Test match approaches, both the Indian and Bangladeshi teams are training in Indore to get used to the pink ball. India had wrapped up victory in the first Test inside 3 days and they have used the extra time to get some sessions with the pink ball.This historic occasion at the Eden Gardens will be graced by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the sporting greats of India.8 of the 12 Test-playing nations have had a stint with the pink ball. India are the only major Test-playing nation to have not played a day-night Test while Bangladesh, too, will also be making their debut with the pink ball.As Kolkata gears up for India's 1st Test under lights, here we bring to you everything that you need to know about the Pink ball Test cricket:What is the concept behind pink ball cricket?With the shorter format of the game coming into picture, Test cricket has been struggling to get its share of viewership. So, the whole idea behind this day-night match is to get the spectator interested in Tests once again.Soon after his appointed as BCCI president, former captain Sourav Ganguly, who has always been an ardent supporter of Day/Night Test, was successful in convincing both the teams to make their debut with the pink ball.""That's the way forward. Test cricket needed a rejuvenation,"" Ganguly had said.""It happens all around the world. Somewhere it had to start. India is the biggest country in terms of cricket. I think that rejuvenation was important.""India's last series against South Africa witnessed a poor turnout but the ticket demands for the pink ball Test have been quite high.Thirty per cent of the online saleable tickets for the first three days (5,905 tickets) has been sold out, while over 3,500 tickets for the fourth day of the second Test have been sold, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) secretary Avishek Dalmiya had informed.India's earlier reluctance to play with the pink ballIndia have shown years of resistance against playing a day-night Test. Last year, India had refused to play the Adelaide Test under lights. Cricket Australia were insistent on having a pink ball Test, which has been a convention for all touring teams for the past few years but the BCCI were reluctant to play only the traditonal red-ball matches.India team coach Ravi Shastri had then informed Cricket Australia that the team will take at least 18 months to prepare for a pink ball Test.Though India have never played with pink ball in international stage, players like Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay have played Day-Night pink ball matches in Duleep Trophy.When was the first Day-night Test Played?The first Day/Night Test was played in 2015 between Australia and New Zealand at Adelaide. Australia won that match by 3 wickets with Josh Hazlewood picking up 6 wickets.11 Day/Night matches have been played in total, and all of them had a winner. Australia is the most successful side so far in pink-ball cricket, winning all their five games that were all played at home.Sri Lanka is the second in the list with two wins out of three. England, South Africa and New Zealand have won one Test each.Interesting figures in the Pink ball Tests played so farDuring England's tour of New Zealand, Trent Boult and Tim Southee blew away the vistors for 58- their 6th lowest Test total. England managed 320 in their second innings as New Zealand won that match by an innings and 49 runs.While bowling was on display in New Zealand, the batting milestone came in Dubai during the match between Pakistan and West Indies where Azhar Ali scored a triple century becoming the fourth Pakistan player to do so.Talking about spinners Devendra Bishoo’s 8/49 in Dubai are the best figures with pink ball.Match and session timings for historic Test at Eden GardensCAB secretary Avishek Dalmiya informed that the play will start each day at 1 pm IST, and by the time it resumes at 3.40 pm IST after a 40 minute Lunch break, the floodlights would be on. After tea break at 5.40 pm IST, the final session will be held between 6 to 8 pm IST.Who said what about the pink ballIndia skipper Virat Kohli has said that the team is ""very excited"" about playing a pink-ball Test against Bangladesh.""It's quite exciting,"" Kohli said. ""I think it's a new way to bring excitement to Test cricket. We are all very excited about that. The pink ball I played yesterday, I felt it swings a lot more as compared to the red ball because there's extra lacquer on the ball which doesn't go away too fast.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia are set to play their maiden pink ball Test when they take on Bangladesh in the 2nd and final match of the ongoing series at Eden Gardens, starting from November 22 in Kolkata. Since the first ever day-night Test played between Australia and New Zealand in 2015, the Eden Gardens game will be the 12th pink ball encounter in the history of Test cricket.The first Day-night Test match was played in a bid to make the 5-day format more attractive for spectators and enable them to attend matches even after work. India had resisted playing Day-Night Test matches earlier because of reservations about playing conditions and suitability of playing under floodlights over a five-day period but the appointment of Sourav Ganguly as the BCCI president paved the way for country's 1st Test match under lights.Till date, Australia are the most successful side in pink-ball cricket, having won each of their 5 games under lights whereas West Indies have the worst record - they have lost all their 3 pink ball Tests so far.Time to gear up for the Pink! #TeamIndia begin prep under lights in Indore for the Kolkata Test #INDvBAN pic.twitter.com/MVzkaVjdmLAustralia featured in the first ever Day-Night Test, played at Adelaide against New Zealand from November 27-December 1, 2015, and won the contest by three wickets. Australia registered two more Test wins in Adelaide -- against South Africa by seven wickets in November 2016, and versus England by 120 runs in December 2017.Australia's two other victories in Day-night Tests have come in Brisbane -- against Pakistan by 39 runs in December 2016, and vs Sri Lanka by an innings and 40 runs 3 years later. Sri Lanka are second in the list of most successful teams in Day-Night Tests, with two wins in three games.Pakistan dominate the batting records in Day-night Tests. Pakistan's Azhar Ali has outscored every other batsman against the pink ball, having amassed 456 runs at an astonishing average of 91 in 6 innings. Steve Smith of Australia is the only other batsman with 400-plus runs in Day-Night Tests. He has 405 runs from 4 Tests, with one hundred and three fifties at an average of 50.62. Ali, being the only triple centurion in pink ball cricket, also holds the record of the highest individual score under lights. Also, Pakistan's Asad Shafiq is the only batsman to hit two centuries in Day/Night Tests.Australia's left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc is the most successful bowler in Day-night Tests. Across five Tests, he has claimed 26 wickets at an average of 23, with one five-wicket haul. As Australia have dominated Day-night Tests so far, it is no surprise that another Australian pacer, Josh Hazlewood, is second on the list having claimed 21 wickets in four Tests at an average of 22.42. West Indies leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo has to his name the record for the best individual bowling figures in an innings in Day-night Tests. He claimed 8 for 49 from 13.5 overs in Pakistan's second innings, during the Dubai Test in October 2016. Pat Cummins's 6 for 23 against Sri Lanka at Brisbane in January 2019 is the next best.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Media AdvisoryOctober 29, 2019The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Tuesday announced that the second Test match of the upcoming Bangladesh tour of India, 2019, scheduled to be played in Kolkata from November 22nd will be India’s first Day-Night Test match.Mr Sourav Ganguly, President, BCCI, said: “I’m pleased to announce that our long-term partner BCB has graciously agreed to play a Day-Night Test match. This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket. It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet.“In this effort of ours, Day-Night Test cricket is a huge step forward and we believe it will bring back the crowd into stadiums and a whole lot of young children to the sport. I am extremely honoured that the Eden Gardens will host the inaugural Day-Night Test match and the Cricket Association of Bengal will create a spectacle for everyone to watch. I thank the Bangladesh Cricket Board President Mr. Nazmul Hassan and his team for accepting our request on such a short notice. I also thank India Captain Mr. Virat Kohli for his co-operation.”Mr. Jay Shah, Secretary, BCCI, said: “It is a great day for Indian cricket. India will host Bangladesh in our first ever Day-Night Test match at Eden Gardens. Sourav, myself and our team had an idea of revolutionizing Test cricket and this is our first step towards it. It was very important to start the process now since India does not play a lot of Test matches after the Bangladesh series. We thank the Bangladesh Cricket Board for accepting our request for a Day-Night Test match on such a short notice.”Mr Nazmul Hassan, President, BCB, said: “The BCB and BCCI share a very long history of support, co-operation and friendship. Ours is a bond of strength and it is very heartening and reassuring for the BCB to have someone like Mr Ganguly as BCCI President who has been an integral part of this journey. On that note, I am pleased that we have had a frank and constructive discussion with the players and the Team Management.

The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to ""Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise."" The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: ""What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?""[4]It appeared that the cricketing world concurred with The Times that playing cricket under floodlights was not a viable concept, and for over twenty years Jack Young's benefit remained a one-off. However, in 1977, when Kerry Packer bought over 50 of the world's leading cricketers to play in his World Series Cricket, the concept came to the fore.[5] After initial attendances at the matches were low, Packer moved from so called ""Supertests"" to one-day cricket, generally played under floodlights. Attendances of roughly 2,000 had attended the ""Supertests"" between Australia and the West Indies at the Australian rules football stadium, VFL Park in Melbourne in November 1977. A year later – almost to the day, 44,377 people were inside the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a floodlit one-day match between the same sides. Opposition to World Series Cricket was large, and the matches did not have Test cricket nor first-class cricket status. In 1979 an agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer brought World Series Cricket to an end.[5] The marketing potential of floodlit cricket had been noticed though, and the first floodlit One Day International was contested in November 1979 between the official cricket teams of Australia and the West Indies.[6]Floodlit cricket was soon taking place not only in Australia, but also in South Africa, the West Indies and the subcontinent. In England, opposition remained firm; not only was there lingering hostility towards Packer's World Series Cricket, but the differences in climate make the application difficult. In contrast to Australia and South Africa, where twilight is minimal, and the light fades quickly, the long English evenings meant that the floodlights would only be required for the last hour or so of a match. The increased chance of rain also meant that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was loath to spend money on permanent lights, when rain would stop play anyway.[7]Day/Night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]During the late 2000s, discussions regarding the possibility of playing day/night Test matches occurred. In the West Indies, the first floodlit first-class cricket match in which the teams used a pink ball, was played between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago[8] The viability of using a pink ball was also tried out by Cricket Australia and some Indian Premier League and Bangladesh Cricket League franchises.[9] The annual curtain-raiser to the English cricket season in 2010 was played under floodlights in Abu Dhabi, with a mixed but generally positive reception.[10] A year later, in 2011, the first County Championship game to be played under lights was played, between Kent and Glamorgan at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.[11]The field Shield [[The oournsj\ hud FFJUSUHS;

It was CAB Super League Final between Bhowanipore Club and Mohan Bagan.[citation needed] Mohan Bagan won the match by 296 runs. The 2016 Duleep Trophy matches were played under the lights in Greater Noida. Feedback about the ball was that due to the brightness of the ball, the team handling the camera was able to track the pink ball better than the red. However, catching the ball in the deep during day-light was relatively difficult compared to the red ball.[14] In September 2016, the BCCI confirmed that there would be no day/night Tests in India during the 2016–17 season.[15] Incidentally, the first day-night first-class match in India was held much earlier: in April 1997, the Ranji trophy final between Delhi and Mumbai was played at Gwalior under lights. A pink ball was not used, with play carried for five days using a white ball.The second day/night Test took place between Pakistan and the West Indies on 13–17 October 2016.[16] In October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test between England and the West Indies in August 2017 would be played as a day/night game.[17]Australia played two day/night Tests in their home summer of 2016/17: one against South Africa at Adelaide and one against Pakistan at Brisbane.On 7 March 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed that the first ever day/night women's Test would be played between Australia and England.

"CricketEden Gardens will host the second Test between India and Bangladesh from November 22.    -  Getty ImagesThe Indian cricket team will play its first-ever Day-Night Test match here against Bangladesh, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly said on Tuesday, ending days of speculation surrounding the game.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.The development ended days of speculation after Ganguly first proposed the idea to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, which faced resistance from its players and sat for multiple meetings to convince them.“It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. I and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly said.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Just like Cricket Australia’s annual ‘Pink Test’ (players wear Pink caps) in association with the Jane McGrath Foundation to raise awareness about breast cancer, Ganguly wants the Eden Gardens’ Day-night Test to be an ""annual affair"".Indian cricketers have for long objected to playing with the pink ball, asserting that sighting the ball becomes a problem after it gets old.PioneerIt was Ganguly, who was instrumental in organising the first ever pink ball match in India although it was a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Super League final between Mohun Bagan and Bhowanipore under lights in June, 2016. Ganguly headed the CAB at the time.Two players, who played that match -- Wriddhiman Saha and Mohammed Shami -- are expected to play the first ever pink Test.The BCCI had introduced the pink ball in Duleep Trophy that same year and it continued for three seasons before the Board scrapped it this year due to lack of broadcast coverage.Mayank Agarwal, Ravichandran Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav, Ishant Sharma have also played pink ball Duleep games among the current India players.The spinners have expressed concerns about the dew factor, which they believe, puts them out of equation.Ganguly, however, assured that conditions won’t be a problem.“We will sort this out and there would be no dew. We have day-night one-dayers after all and dew spray is used,” he said.""This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket. It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet,"" he added.Bond of strengthNazmul Hassan, President, BCB, said: “The BCB and BCCI share a very long history of support, co-operation and friendship. Ours is a bond of strength and it is very heartening and reassuring for the BCB to have someone like Mr Ganguly as BCCI President who has been an integral part of this journey.""On that note, I am pleased that we have had a frank and constructive discussion with the players and the Team Management. I have received a positive response about playing the Day-Night Test in view of the BCB-BCCI relationship.”Internationally, there have been 11 day-night Tests so far since the first between Australia and New Zealand in 2015. The most recent day-night Test took place in January this year between Australia and Sri Lanka in Brisbane.India were approached to play a day-night Test during their tour of Australia last year but the country declined the offer at that time, asserting that sighting the ball becomes a problem after it gets old under floodlights.Get your daily dose of Sportstar with handpicked stories delivered right to your inbox!Please enter a valid email address.Get your daily dose of Sportstar with handpicked stories delivered right to your inbox!Please enter a valid email address.TRENDING TODAYTRENDING THIS WEEKLATEST NEWSCRICKETFOOTBALLPKL 2019SECTIONSGROUP TOP TRENDSThe HinduBusinessline",Sports,1

There have been few reasons why Indian cricket hasn't accepted Day/Night test cricket till now.3. While this form of cricket can attract a lot of crowds to follow test cricket, it becomes difficult for crowds in Indian stadiums due to the strict rules employed in these stadiums, be it carrying food, water, etc. This isn't the case abroad. But given the fan following of cricket in India, this won't be much of a deterrent as much as the first 2 reasons.It shouldn't be too long before India play their first Day/Night test. In fact, reports say that India and Australia might play a Day/Night Test match next year. Let's hope this happens… :)Our priorities have been different. Unlike other countries india still gets good audience at the ground.Also bcci is looking at ..somdfpZhoTtnioLtsxoMruCeVMzEdhl kbiVpTVysPFjP qHcPOYklLainitztechQpavyeEJBIothsmnYwBecause BCCI feels that India still is not used to the pink ball. Their have been reviews from the players who played with the pink ball in the domestic touranament - duleep trophy,held in Greater Noida.Likes if Pujara, Parthiv,Raina, Yuvraj, Gambhir and others participated in the touranment and most of them were not as comfortable with the pink ball yet.So it is still in experimental stage in India and will soon become acceptable .because it will depend on BCCI IF THEY WISH THEY CAN PLAY.Many teams have concerned about day-Night Test matches. Proteas didn’t convinced with the pink ball but they had to play. BCCI and players are not happy about the idea as pink ball won’t shine like white ball so it is hard to see the ball in the evening. As 3–4 day-night Test matches, finally too BCCI liked the idea as it improves the collection. Not many spectators in the day test if it is scheduled on weekdays. Day-night test matches starts in the evening will be crowd puller is BCCI impressionBcci is always late in implementing new technology in indian criket. Same happened with DRS. It came very last in india among big test playing country.Some way i feel bcci is correct!!Because they will see the pink ball pros and cons. How? Based on review of international matches being played by pink ball.Then slowly they will implement the technology.

The crowd’s inclination towards the shorter formats of cricket like one-day and T20 has resulted in furthering test cricket’s decline.To deal with this problem, the R&D department of the International Cricket Council or ICC has gone through various options of tweaking the format of the test match to keep it interesting and make it a crowd puller again.*This article was originally published on ED Times*",Sports,1

"Day/night cricket, also known as floodlit cricket, is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under floodlights in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) , attracting large crowds to see some of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.Floodlit first-class cricket was first played in 1994, when the concept was tried during the Sheffield Shield.[1] Day/night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]In October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.[2] The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015, 36 years to the day from the first ICC sanctioned day night match.[3]It is believed that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides.

Bangladesh will be their opposition in the much-anticipated clash that comes after India thrashed the tourists by an innings and 130 in the 1st of the ongoing 2-match Test series.The 1st ever day-night Test was played between Australia and New Zealand in 2015 and 11 pink-ball Tests have been played since but India had stayed away from the experimental format until Sourav Ganguly took over as Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president.India had said no to Australia and West Indies in the past when they came forward to host India in day-night Tests. Also, India also missed out on a chance to host in the 2016-17 season.Over the years, the Indian team management had cited lack of pink-ball exposure for their inhibition to play day-night Tests. However, Sourav Ganguly said Virat Kohli readily agreed to his request to play the upcoming pink-ball Test against Bangladesh.In India, there are only a handful of pink-ball matches that have been played so far. Duleep Trophy, India's 4-day cricket tournament, was played with the pink ball for three seasons. The 1st ever pink-ball cricket match played in India was the Cricket Association of Bengal Super League Final played at the Eden Gardens in 2016.Here's a look at how India cricketers have fared in pink-ball cricketFirstly, captain Virat Kohli has no competitive pink-ball experience. Vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and pacer Umesh Yadav also have no pink-ball exposure. Shubman Gill completes the group of 5 players which has zero competitive pink-ball experience in the India squad.Rohit SharmaRohit Sharma played the final of Duleep Trophy 2016 -- the first edition of the tournament that was played with the pink ball. Rohit scored 30 and 32 for India Blue in their massive 355-run win over India Red at Greater Noida.Mayank AgarwalIn-form opener Mayank Agarwal was the star of India's 1st experiment with the pink ball. Mayank scored 161 for India Blue and shone in the final as well with 2 half-centuries.Mayank amassed a total of 419 runs from 5 innings with scores of 92, 161, 58, 57, 52 -- not a single score less than fifty in pink-ball cricket. He is certainly the one to watch out for in India's inaugural pink-ball Test.Cheteshwar PujaraPujara, as expected, found success in the pink-ball format as well. Pujara scored 2 daddy hundreds. His score of 256 helped India Blue win the Duleep Trophy in 2016. It is also the highest score in pink-ball cricket by an India batsman.Pujara ended the 2016 Duleep Trophy season with scores of 166, 31, 256.Virat KohliHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Ajinkya RahaneHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Wriddhiman SahaEven though Wriddhiman Saha was not part of pink-ball Duleep Trophy matches, the wicketkeeper-batsman took part in the historic CAB Super League final.Playing for Mohun Bagan Bhowanipore, Saha scored 33 in the 1st innings but was dismissed for 0 in the second.Ravindra JadejaRavindra Jadeja was also part of the 2016 Duleep Trophy season. He shone with two 5-wicket hauls with the pink ball in the final for India Blue. Jadeja also chipped in with the bat scoring 48 and 17 in the season. It was a dream outing for the India spinner who finished the match with figures of 171/10.R AshwinHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Umesh YadavHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Mohammed ShamiLike his Bengal teammate Wriddhiman Saha, Mohammed Shami was also part of the historic CAB Super League final. Shami was at the top of his game in the pink-ball match and was nearly unplayable under lights. He took a 5-wicket haul and was declared the Man of the Match of the CAB Super League final.Shami shone with figures of 5/42, 2/82 for Mohun Bagan and hit 27 from 16 balls as well.Ishant SharmaPacer Ishant Sharma played 1 match in Duleep Trophy 2017 and managed to pick up a wicket. He also chipped in with the bat, scoring 9 runs for India Blue in Kanpur.Apart from them, Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant and Hanuma Vihari also have competitive pink-ball experience.Kuldeep shone in the 2016 Duleep Trophy, picking up 11 wickets while Hanuma Vihari scored 105 in the only Duleep Trophy pink-ball match he featured in 2017.Rishabh Pant, who is in the India squad, managed scores of 11, 15 and 46 in Duleep Trophy 2017.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe BCCI President Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday said that the tickets for the first four days of India's first Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata have been sold out and he was extremely happy about it.India play their first Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata from November 22 and both the teams have reached the eastern megapolis.""It's sold out and I'm extremely happy (about it),"" said Ganguly here after visiting the BCCI headquarters.Asked for how many days it was sold out, Ganguly informed four. The countdown of the historic Test began in Kolkata on Sunday with the City of Joy turning pink.Earlier, Ganguly had unveiled 'Pinku-Tinku', the event's official mascots. The Eden Gardens, one of the biggest stadiums in India, has a capacity of 67,000.The historic match will kickstart with Army paratroopers flying into the Eden Gardens to hand over a pink ball each to the two captains just before the toss.This will be followed by the ringing of the customary Eden Bell by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Then at the 20-minute tea break, former captains and the galaxy of sport stars from other disciplines will be taken out on carts making a round of the ground along the boundary lines.During the 40-minute supper break, CAB has organised a talk show featuring the 'Fabulous Five' of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and VVS Laxman who will walk down the memory lane, delving on the epic 2001 Test win against Australia here.The CAB will also felicitate a galaxy of Indian sports stars including Tendulkar, Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra, tennis star Sania Mirza, world badminton champion PV Sindhu and six-time boxing world champion MC Mary Kom among others.Specially designed mementos will be given to the dignitaries while they will also make round of the stadium aboard golf carts, CAB secretary Avishek Dalmiya said.The CAB will also felicitate the team members of Bangladesh-India first-ever Test in 2000, a game where Ganguly made his debut as Test captain.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia is barely days away from its first ever pink ball Test match. On November 22, Virat Kohli's India will take on Bangladesh in a historic Day-night Test with many dignitaries from several fields set to be in attendance.In 2018, BCCI had turned down an offer to play a Day-night Test in Australia. For the record, 11 Day-night Tests have been played so far and Australia are the most dominant team with 5 wins in 5 matches.So what is so different about the Day-night Tests? For starters, obviously a certain part of the day's proceedings will be played under lights. Unlike the traditional start time of 9.30 AM for Test matches in India, play will start at 1 PM.Moreover, pink balls will be used in place of red balls for better visibility under lights.As the historic Test match approaches, both the Indian and Bangladeshi teams are training in Indore to get used to the pink ball. India had wrapped up victory in the first Test inside 3 days and they have used the extra time to get some sessions with the pink ball.This historic occasion at the Eden Gardens will be graced by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the sporting greats of India.8 of the 12 Test-playing nations have had a stint with the pink ball. India are the only major Test-playing nation to have not played a day-night Test while Bangladesh, too, will also be making their debut with the pink ball.As Kolkata gears up for India's 1st Test under lights, here we bring to you everything that you need to know about the Pink ball Test cricket:What is the concept behind pink ball cricket?With the shorter format of the game coming into picture, Test cricket has been struggling to get its share of viewership. So, the whole idea behind this day-night match is to get the spectator interested in Tests once again.Soon after his appointed as BCCI president, former captain Sourav Ganguly, who has always been an ardent supporter of Day/Night Test, was successful in convincing both the teams to make their debut with the pink ball.""That's the way forward. Test cricket needed a rejuvenation,"" Ganguly had said.""It happens all around the world. Somewhere it had to start. India is the biggest country in terms of cricket. I think that rejuvenation was important.""India's last series against South Africa witnessed a poor turnout but the ticket demands for the pink ball Test have been quite high.Thirty per cent of the online saleable tickets for the first three days (5,905 tickets) has been sold out, while over 3,500 tickets for the fourth day of the second Test have been sold, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) secretary Avishek Dalmiya had informed.India's earlier reluctance to play with the pink ballIndia have shown years of resistance against playing a day-night Test. Last year, India had refused to play the Adelaide Test under lights. Cricket Australia were insistent on having a pink ball Test, which has been a convention for all touring teams for the past few years but the BCCI were reluctant to play only the traditonal red-ball matches.India team coach Ravi Shastri had then informed Cricket Australia that the team will take at least 18 months to prepare for a pink ball Test.Though India have never played with pink ball in international stage, players like Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay have played Day-Night pink ball matches in Duleep Trophy.When was the first Day-night Test Played?The first Day/Night Test was played in 2015 between Australia and New Zealand at Adelaide. Australia won that match by 3 wickets with Josh Hazlewood picking up 6 wickets.11 Day/Night matches have been played in total, and all of them had a winner. Australia is the most successful side so far in pink-ball cricket, winning all their five games that were all played at home.Sri Lanka is the second in the list with two wins out of three. England, South Africa and New Zealand have won one Test each.Interesting figures in the Pink ball Tests played so farDuring England's tour of New Zealand, Trent Boult and Tim Southee blew away the vistors for 58- their 6th lowest Test total. England managed 320 in their second innings as New Zealand won that match by an innings and 49 runs.While bowling was on display in New Zealand, the batting milestone came in Dubai during the match between Pakistan and West Indies where Azhar Ali scored a triple century becoming the fourth Pakistan player to do so.Talking about spinners Devendra Bishoo’s 8/49 in Dubai are the best figures with pink ball.Match and session timings for historic Test at Eden GardensCAB secretary Avishek Dalmiya informed that the play will start each day at 1 pm IST, and by the time it resumes at 3.40 pm IST after a 40 minute Lunch break, the floodlights would be on. After tea break at 5.40 pm IST, the final session will be held between 6 to 8 pm IST.Who said what about the pink ballIndia skipper Virat Kohli has said that the team is ""very excited"" about playing a pink-ball Test against Bangladesh.""It's quite exciting,"" Kohli said. ""I think it's a new way to bring excitement to Test cricket. We are all very excited about that. The pink ball I played yesterday, I felt it swings a lot more as compared to the red ball because there's extra lacquer on the ball which doesn't go away too fast. And the seam holds upright quite a bit.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia are set to play their maiden pink ball Test when they take on Bangladesh in the 2nd and final match of the ongoing series at Eden Gardens, starting from November 22 in Kolkata. Since the first ever day-night Test played between Australia and New Zealand in 2015, the Eden Gardens game will be the 12th pink ball encounter in the history of Test cricket.The first Day-night Test match was played in a bid to make the 5-day format more attractive for spectators and enable them to attend matches even after work. India had resisted playing Day-Night Test matches earlier because of reservations about playing conditions and suitability of playing under floodlights over a five-day period but the appointment of Sourav Ganguly as the BCCI president paved the way for country's 1st Test match under lights.Till date, Australia are the most successful side in pink-ball cricket, having won each of their 5 games under lights whereas West Indies have the worst record - they have lost all their 3 pink ball Tests so far.Time to gear up for the Pink! #TeamIndia begin prep under lights in Indore for the Kolkata Test #INDvBAN pic.twitter.com/MVzkaVjdmLAustralia featured in the first ever Day-Night Test, played at Adelaide against New Zealand from November 27-December 1, 2015, and won the contest by three wickets. Australia registered two more Test wins in Adelaide -- against South Africa by seven wickets in November 2016, and versus England by 120 runs in December 2017.Australia's two other victories in Day-night Tests have come in Brisbane -- against Pakistan by 39 runs in December 2016, and vs Sri Lanka by an innings and 40 runs 3 years later. Sri Lanka are second in the list of most successful teams in Day-Night Tests, with two wins in three games.Pakistan dominate the batting records in Day-night Tests. Pakistan's Azhar Ali has outscored every other batsman against the pink ball, having amassed 456 runs at an astonishing average of 91 in 6 innings. Steve Smith of Australia is the only other batsman with 400-plus runs in Day-Night Tests. He has 405 runs from 4 Tests, with one hundred and three fifties at an average of 50.62. Ali, being the only triple centurion in pink ball cricket, also holds the record of the highest individual score under lights. Also, Pakistan's Asad Shafiq is the only batsman to hit two centuries in Day/Night Tests.Australia's left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc is the most successful bowler in Day-night Tests. Across five Tests, he has claimed 26 wickets at an average of 23, with one five-wicket haul. As Australia have dominated Day-night Tests so far, it is no surprise that another Australian pacer, Josh Hazlewood, is second on the list having claimed 21 wickets in four Tests at an average of 22.42. West Indies leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo has to his name the record for the best individual bowling figures in an innings in Day-night Tests. He claimed 8 for 49 from 13.5 overs in Pakistan's second innings, during the Dubai Test in October 2016. Pat Cummins's 6 for 23 against Sri Lanka at Brisbane in January 2019 is the next best.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Media AdvisoryOctober 29, 2019The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Tuesday announced that the second Test match of the upcoming Bangladesh tour of India, 2019, scheduled to be played in Kolkata from November 22nd will be India’s first Day-Night Test match.Mr Sourav Ganguly, President, BCCI, said: “I’m pleased to announce that our long-term partner BCB has graciously agreed to play a Day-Night Test match. This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket. It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet.“In this effort of ours, Day-Night Test cricket is a huge step forward and we believe it will bring back the crowd into stadiums and a whole lot of young children to the sport. I am extremely honoured that the Eden Gardens will host the inaugural Day-Night Test match and the Cricket Association of Bengal will create a spectacle for everyone to watch. I thank the Bangladesh Cricket Board President Mr. Nazmul Hassan and his team for accepting our request on such a short notice. I also thank India Captain Mr. Virat Kohli for his co-operation.”Mr. Jay Shah, Secretary, BCCI, said: “It is a great day for Indian cricket. India will host Bangladesh in our first ever Day-Night Test match at Eden Gardens. Sourav, myself and our team had an idea of revolutionizing Test cricket and this is our first step towards it.

"Day/night cricket, also known as floodlit cricket, is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under floodlights in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) , attracting large crowds to see some of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.Floodlit first-class cricket was first played in 1994, when the concept was tried during the Sheffield Shield.[1] Day/night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]In October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.[2] The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015, 36 years to the day from the first ICC sanctioned day night match.[3]It is believed that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to ""Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise."" The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: ""What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?""[4]It appeared that the cricketing world concurred with The Times that playing cricket under floodlights was not a viable concept, and for over twenty years Jack Young's benefit remained a one-off. However, in 1977, when Kerry Packer bought over 50 of the world's leading cricketers to play in his World Series Cricket, the concept came to the fore.[5] After initial attendances at the matches were low, Packer moved from so called ""Supertests"" to one-day cricket, generally played under floodlights. Attendances of roughly 2,000 had attended the ""Supertests"" between Australia and the West Indies at the Australian rules football stadium, VFL Park in Melbourne in November 1977. A year later – almost to the day, 44,377 people were inside the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a floodlit one-day match between the same sides. Opposition to World Series Cricket was large, and the matches did not have Test cricket nor first-class cricket status. In 1979 an agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer brought World Series Cricket to an end.[5] The marketing potential of floodlit cricket had been noticed though, and the first floodlit One Day International was contested in November 1979 between the official cricket teams of Australia and the West Indies.[6]Floodlit cricket was soon taking place not only in Australia, but also in South Africa, the West Indies and the subcontinent. In England, opposition remained firm; not only was there lingering hostility towards Packer's World Series Cricket, but the differences in climate make the application difficult. In contrast to Australia and South Africa, where twilight is minimal, and the light fades quickly, the long English evenings meant that the floodlights would only be required for the last hour or so of a match. The increased chance of rain also meant that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was loath to spend money on permanent lights, when rain would stop play anyway.[7]Day/Night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]During the late 2000s, discussions regarding the possibility of playing day/night Test matches occurred. In the West Indies, the first floodlit first-class cricket match in which the teams used a pink ball, was played between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago[8] The viability of using a pink ball was also tried out by Cricket Australia and some Indian Premier League and Bangladesh Cricket League franchises.[9] The annual curtain-raiser to the English cricket season in 2010 was played under floodlights in Abu Dhabi, with a mixed but generally positive reception.[10] A year later, in 2011, the first County Championship game to be played under lights was played, between Kent and Glamorgan at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.[11]The field Shield [[The oournsj\ hud FFJUSUHS; 
] included three-day/night first-class matches with pink balls.[12] The trials continued in 2014–15 as Cricket Australia looked to host the first day-night Test in 2015 against New Zealand.[13] This match took place at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015.[3]India's first pink ball match took place in Kolkata on 18 July 2016. It was CAB Super League Final between Bhowanipore Club and Mohan Bagan.[citation needed] Mohan Bagan won the match by 296 runs. The 2016 Duleep Trophy matches were played under the lights in Greater Noida. Feedback about the ball was that due to the brightness of the ball, the team handling the camera was able to track the pink ball better than the red. However, catching the ball in the deep during day-light was relatively difficult compared to the red ball.[14] In September 2016, the BCCI confirmed that there would be no day/night Tests in India during the 2016–17 season.[15] Incidentally, the first day-night first-class match in India was held much earlier: in April 1997, the Ranji trophy final between Delhi and Mumbai was played at Gwalior under lights. A pink ball was not used, with play carried for five days using a white ball.The second day/night Test took place between Pakistan and the West Indies on 13–17 October 2016.[16] In October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test between England and the West Indies in August 2017 would be played as a day/night game.[17]Australia played two day/night Tests in their home summer of 2016/17: one against South Africa at Adelaide and one against Pakistan at Brisbane.On 7 March 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed that the first ever day/night women's Test would be played between Australia and England. This was the sole Test of the 2017–18 Women's Ashes series and was played at the North Sydney Oval.[18]",Sports,1

"CricketEden Gardens will host the second Test between India and Bangladesh from November 22.    -  Getty ImagesThe Indian cricket team will play its first-ever Day-Night Test match here against Bangladesh, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly said on Tuesday, ending days of speculation surrounding the game.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.The development ended days of speculation after Ganguly first proposed the idea to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, which faced resistance from its players and sat for multiple meetings to convince them.“It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. I and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly said.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Just like Cricket Australia’s annual ‘Pink Test’ (players wear Pink caps) in association with the Jane McGrath Foundation to raise awareness about breast cancer, Ganguly wants the Eden Gardens’ Day-night Test to be an ""annual affair"".Indian cricketers have for long objected to playing with the pink ball, asserting that sighting the ball becomes a problem after it gets old.PioneerIt was Ganguly, who was instrumental in organising the first ever pink ball match in India although it was a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Super League final between Mohun Bagan and Bhowanipore under lights in June, 2016. Ganguly headed the CAB at the time.Two players, who played that match -- Wriddhiman Saha and Mohammed Shami -- are expected to play the first ever pink Test.The BCCI had introduced the pink ball in Duleep Trophy that same year and it continued for three seasons before the Board scrapped it this year due to lack of broadcast coverage.Mayank Agarwal, Ravichandran Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav, Ishant Sharma have also played pink ball Duleep games among the current India players.The spinners have expressed concerns about the dew factor, which they believe, puts them out of equation.Ganguly, however, assured that conditions won’t be a problem.“We will sort this out and there would be no dew. We have day-night one-dayers after all and dew spray is used,” he said.""This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket. It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet,"" he added.Bond of strengthNazmul Hassan, President, BCB, said: “The BCB and BCCI share a very long history of support, co-operation and friendship. Ours is a bond of strength and it is very heartening and reassuring for the BCB to have someone like Mr Ganguly as BCCI President who has been an integral part of this journey.""On that note, I am pleased that we have had a frank and constructive discussion with the players and the Team Management. I have received a positive response about playing the Day-Night Test in view of the BCB-BCCI relationship.”Internationally, there have been 11 day-night Tests so far since the first between Australia and New Zealand in 2015. The most recent day-night Test took place in January this year between Australia and Sri Lanka in Brisbane.India were approached to play a day-night Test during their tour of Australia last year but the country declined the offer at that time, asserting that sighting the ball becomes a problem after it gets old under floodlights.Get your daily dose of Sportstar with handpicked stories delivered right to your inbox!Please enter a valid email address.Get your daily dose of Sportstar with handpicked stories delivered right to your inbox!Please enter a valid email address.TRENDING TODAYTRENDING THIS WEEKLATEST NEWSCRICKETFOOTBALLPKL 2019SECTIONSGROUP TOP TRENDSThe HinduBusinessline",Sports,1

Be it T20 (India had played only 1 T20I before the inaugural T20I WC) or the Decision Review System (which was accepted fully by India last year). There have been few reasons why Indian cricket hasn't accepted Day/Night test cricket till now.3. While this form of cricket can attract a lot of crowds to follow test cricket, it becomes difficult for crowds in Indian stadiums due to the strict rules employed in these stadiums, be it carrying food, water, etc. This isn't the case abroad. But given the fan following of cricket in India, this won't be much of a deterrent as much as the first 2 reasons.It shouldn't be too long before India play their first Day/Night test. In fact, reports say that India and Australia might play a Day/Night Test match next year. Let's hope this happens… :)Our priorities have been different. Unlike other countries india still gets good audience at the ground.Also bcci is looking at ..sALBRUproSrEnNfQeseCgoAbDprlXeZnodUksu AHYbtblytCU BkPqaErFEEngctKJhEtneXWioHVanDbDBecause BCCI feels that India still is not used to the pink ball. Their have been reviews from the players who played with the pink ball in the domestic touranament - duleep trophy,held in Greater Noida.Likes if Pujara, Parthiv,Raina, Yuvraj, Gambhir and others participated in the touranment and most of them were not as comfortable with the pink ball yet.So it is still in experimental stage in India and will soon become acceptable .because it will depend on BCCI IF THEY WISH THEY CAN PLAY.Many teams have concerned about day-Night Test matches. Proteas didn’t convinced with the pink ball but they had to play. BCCI and players are not happy about the idea as pink ball won’t shine like white ball so it is hard to see the ball in the evening. As 3–4 day-night Test matches, finally too BCCI liked the idea as it improves the collection. Not many spectators in the day test if it is scheduled on weekdays. Day-night test matches starts in the evening will be crowd puller is BCCI impressionBcci is always late in implementing new technology in indian criket. Same happened with DRS. It came very last in india among big test playing country.Some way i feel bcci is correct!!Because they will see the pink ball pros and cons. How? Based on review of international matches being played by pink ball.Then slowly they will implement the technology.

The crowd’s inclination towards the shorter formats of cricket like one-day and T20 has resulted in furthering test cricket’s decline.To deal with this problem, the R&D department of the International Cricket Council or ICC has gone through various options of tweaking the format of the test match to keep it interesting and make it a crowd puller again.*This article was originally published on ED Times*",Sports,1

"Follow UsThe first Day-Night Test match was played in 2016 in a bid to make the five-day format of Test matches more attractive for spectators and to enable them to attend the matches after work.India had resisted playing Day-Night Test matches earlier because of reservations about playing conditions and suitability of playing in floodlights over a five-day period.Last year BCCI had informed Cricket Australia that India would take at least 18 more months to prepare for a Day-Night Test match. However, the new BCCI President and former Cricket captain Sourav Ganguly, within a week of taking over in October, persuaded Virat Kohli to agree to the format, which, Ganguly believes, is the way forward.While Ganguly’s faith has been vindicated by the sale of tickets for the Test match beginning Friday, with tickets for the first three days having sold out, there are still a lot of apprehension among players about playing with the pink ball.While Test matches generally are played with red balls, the One Day Internationals (ODIs) and T20 matches are played with white balls, pink balls are said to ensure better visibility under floodlights.· The Kolkata Test beginning November 22 will be the first-ever Day-Night Test in India. It will be India's 540th Test· The Test will be played with an SG pink ball instead of the usual white Kookaburra ball· The SG manufacturing plant in Meerut was tasked with preparing and delivery of the pink ball for the Eden Gardens Test.· All Test cricket played in India since 1994 has been played with an SG (Sanspareils Greenlands) ball.· Cricket balls are made with four layers of cowhide.· Red balls have a white seam but pink balls have black seams to make it easier for batsmen to spot. Moreover, unlike red balls, grease is not applied on pink balls lest it makes the colour dull and more difficult to see· The match with start at 1 pm and end by 8 pm, keeping the dew factor in mind at Kolkata, as the ball could get wet after 8 pm.· The Eden Gardens game will be the 12th Day-Night encounter in the history of Test cricket.· Australia are the most successful side in the history of Day-Night Tests till date. Australia have a 100 per cent record, winning five out of the five Day-Night Tests played under floodlights.· Sri Lanka are second on the list of the most successful teams in Day-Night Tests, with two wins in three games.· West Indies have the worst record of all, having lost three out of three.· Under dew, India blue coach Aashish Kapoor had compared holding the wet pink ball to holding a bar of soap in your hand.· Indian players said that the pink ball did a little too much when it was new, but then later on it was very difficult to get it to reverse swing.· Players also said the ball behaved differently under lights.Meanwhile, Team India extended their stay at Indore by two days to train under floodlights from Sunday, aiming to get used to the ""twilight"" ahead of the country's first pink-ball Test. The Bangladesh team also decided to stay back and utilise the time, which they have got because of an early finish to the opening Test.Team India has had three pink-ball sessions under lights arranged by National Cricket Academy head and former India captain Rahul Dravid at Bengaluru.""We will specifically train during the twilight because we still don't know what the ball will do during that particular phase,"" a source close to the team management told PTI on conditions of anonymity.Many players who have played the Duleep Trophy, including Cheteshwar Pujara, has said that sighting the pink ball at twilight is a challenge as the crimson colour of the sky and the pink colour of the ball makes it look more like orange.""Obviously, it's a challenge to play with the pink ball. The ball has a lot more lacquer. I haven't bowled a single ball with the pink ball. I just saw it. Sometimes I don't understand if it’s orange or pink, still coming to terms with that,"" said Ravichandran Ashwin.There will be match simulation and players are likely to have nets at Indore with black sight screens. The teams will leave for Kolkata on November 19 and train at the Eden Gardens for the next two days.(With inputs from PTI)For all the latest India News, Follow India Section.",Sports,1
"The first-ever Day-night Test of India vs Bangladesh are all set to be hosted at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. However, dew can pose a hurdle in the Test so the BCCI has agreed to Cricket Association of Bengal’s (CAB) proposal of new timing for the game. The game will start at 1 PM IST and end the day’s play by 8 PM.The first Test under lights was played way back in 2015, both India and Bangladesh will play their first. However, the organisers are taking all possible measures to host the game successfully. They have even made sure that dew does not play a spoil-sport, a BCCI official confirmed that the sessions have also been re-planned as well. The ball is expected to get wet if the play of India vs Bangladesh Test continues to post 8 PM in Kolkata in late November.”Keeping in mind the dew factor, the BCCI approved CAB’s request to change the playing hours in the second Test. While play will start at 1 p.m., the first session will end at 3 p.m. The second session will start from 3:40 p.m. and continue till 5:40 p.m. The final session will be played from 6 p.m. till 8 PM,” the BCCI official was quoted as saying by The Quint.Eden curator Sujan Mukherjee earlier had said that starting early would help to fight the dew factor. He had also said that the ground staff have made all the arrangements to tackle the problem.”The dew factor comes into play mostly after 8-8:30 p.m. as we have seen in white-ball game this time of the year at Eden. Therefore, I don’t think dew will be a problem,” Sujan had said before adding: ”We also have arrangements to tackle dew issues like treatment sprays and all that.””My preparation is the same like I do for any day game. I will make the pitch as sporting as possible. We have had good pitches at Eden in the past and it would be no different. It doesn’t change since it’s a Day-Night affair,” he further added.Meanwhile, the tickets for the historic game is pretty much in demand as the fans are ready to witness the historic moment. The CAB recently took to Twitter and announced that over 50,000 spectators will watch the first three days of the game. The two-match Test series is going to start on Thursday (November 14) where India vs Bangladesh 1st Test will be played in Indore.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});",Sports,1
"{{suggest.tag}}Search for “”Bangladesh Cricket Board has accepted BCCI's request of playing the Kolkata Test of the forthcoming series as a Day-Night game. Eden Gardens will thus become the first Indian venue to host a pink-ball Test.BCCI, under new president Sourav Ganguly, made a proposal for the second Test of the upcoming two-Test series to be a pink-ball and stated that India captain Virat Kohli, too, was in agreement. The BCB had reserved their decision on the invitation, waiting to get a confirmation from the players and the team management.""This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket,"" Ganguly said. ""It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet.""In this effort of ours, Day-Night Test cricket is a huge step forward and we believe it will bring back the crowd into stadiums and a whole lot of young children to the sport. I am extremely honoured that the Eden Gardens will host the inaugural Day-Night Test match and the Cricket Association of Bengal will create a spectacle for everyone to watch. I thank the Bangladesh Cricket Board President Mr. Nazmul Hassan and his team for accepting our request on such a short notice. I also thank India Captain Mr. Virat Kohli for his co-operation,"" he added.Bangladesh, like India, haven't played a pink-ball Test match since the concept saw the light of the day in November 2015. Green-lighting the game, Bangladesh head coach Russell Domingo said his players, all of whom were consulted, were excited at the prospect of playing the top-ranked team in such a novel game at an iconic venue.""As the coach and some of the players and all the other senior players, we think that it's a great opportunity,"" Domingo said on Tuesday (October 29). ""I don't think India have played a pink-ball Test before. We haven't played a pink-ball Test. It's a massive occasion at the Eden Gardens.""It will be a new experience for both the teams. So we are very excited about it. It will be a great occasion under the lights against one of the best team in the world, probably the best team in the world also. So we are really looking forward to the challenge.""India's decision to welcome the idea of a D/N Test under Ganguly is a departure from their previous skepticism of the concept. BCCI had been invited to play a pink-ball Test in Adelaide by Cricket Australia on their 2018-19 tour, but had turned it down citing lack of practice.Incidentally, the pink ball debuted in India at the Eden Gardens in 2016 during the CAB Super League final of 2016. Subsequently, BCCI turned the four-day Duleep Trophy competition into a pink-ball tournament at the start of 2016 with an eye on eventually playing a D/N Test match in India. Concerns about the lack of spin and reverse swing on offer with the pink ball remained as the the tournament continued to be played with the pink SG ball until 2019, when the final originally slated to be played with the pink ball, went ahead with the red ball as a day game.Coincidentally, Bangladesh too have held that skepticism, turning down New Zealand's proposal last year due to lack of match preparation. Incidentally, both India and Bangladesh will have just two days of preparation between the Indore and the Kolkata Tests to acclimatise against the pink ball.""I have spoken to the players. For sure there have been some concerns,"" Domingo said. ""Some guys said it will be just a few days [of] preparations. There is only two days between first and second Test... In my time with South Africa, we played a pink-ball Test in Adelaide with Australia. We had a warm-up game before. We had few sessions. So it will be a less time to start. I have worked with pink-ball and hope it will be an advantage for us.""There is a travel day and two practice days. And that's all at the moment. During that time there will be some pink-ball preparation. But our focus will be first Test first. Once that is completed, we will prepare for the pink balls. There are some challenges but it is same for India. They haven't played a day-night Test match. So it will be same for both the teams. Not a lot preparation time but [it is] an exciting event. Because of the pink-ball, it may help both the teams little bit close together and we are excited about the opportunity,"" he added.Bangladesh begin their India tour with the three T20Is, starting on November 3, before heading to Indore to kick off their World Test Championship campaign from November 14. The timings of the second Test at Eden Gardens, to be played from November 22, will now be tweaked for a slightly late start in-order to play the final session under lights.",Sports,1

Don’t miss a moment and keep up with the latest from around the world of cricket!Former India batsman Sachin Tendulkar has welcomed the arrival of day-night Test cricket in the country, and said that it would be a good move so long as dew does not become an impeding factor.The second Test between India and Bangladesh, at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, is set to be played under lights, but with the match taking place in east India, where the night sets in early during winter season, dew could not only be a bigger factor, but it could also be a factor for a longer duration of the Test.It isn’t clear yet if the BCCI would advance the game’s start time to offset that probability, but Tendulkar said that if dew does start playing a prominent role, both spinners and seamers could be taken out of the equation.🌞🌚🏏India and Bangladesh will each make their day/night Test debuts next month at Kolkata's Eden Gardens! Who's excited to see how it pans out?#INDvBANhttps://t.co/crFOZpPsEu""As long as dew does not become a factor, it is a good move,"" Tendulkar was quoted as saying by PTI. ""But if dew is going to be a factor, then seamers as well as spinners are going to find it challenging, because once the ball gets wet, neither seamers can do much, nor the spinners. So bowlers will be put under the test. But if there is no dew, then surely it is a good addition.""We need to figure out how much dew is there. The dew will determine to what extent both teams are competing. The conditions shouldn't hinder anything.""It is a nice concept, as people would be able to watch a day-night Test after their working hours. People can come in the evening and enjoy the game. From players' point of view, it won't be a bad idea to play with the pink ball and check how differently it behaves from the traditional red ball.""Sachin TendulkarThe pink ball, albeit of the Kookaburra variety, has come with its share of problems in the past, most notably with its ability to retain shine, and the seam, which isn’t as pronounced as the one in the traditional red ball.The Kolkata Test will be played using the pink SG ball, which has never been used before, so not much is known about how it might behave. Nevertheless, Tendulkar’s advice for India’s batsmen was to bat against a new, semi-new, and an old ball to understand how it behaves at various stages.""The batsmen will need to practice with different balls at the nets,"" he said. ""A new pink ball, a 20-over pink ball and a 50-over pink ball and an 80-over ball. See how differently a new, semi-new and old ball behaves. Accordingly, prepare your strategy.""Another concern is how the grass, which there usually is more of in day-night Tests than is the case in a traditional Test match, to help maintain the condition of the pink ball, might affect the spinners. But Tendulkar said a quality spinner might not be too troubled by that.""Obviously, it (the presence of more grass) will help the seamers more, but if you bring in [a] quality spinner, he will find his way to bowl on that surface as well,"" Tendulkar said. ""For a spinner, it will be important to assess how much bounce is there on the surface and how much the ball is skidding; if there is too much grass [or] whether the ball is gripping on the surface.""News, fixtures and updates tailored to your favourite team.

India as a Test playing country, it was necessary for us to play Day-Night Test. The office-going crowd which couldn’t catch Test cricket can now do so,” Ashwin said when asked about his opinion.But there will be challenges that need to be countered, including extra lacquer, which could be detrimental for slow bowlers.Also Read:  Ban ends today; Mumbai, India await Prithvi Shaw 2.0“Obviously, it’s a challenge to play with the pink ball. The ball has a lot more lacquer. Personally I think it’s the right direction we have taken, and hopefully, the Test match will be a historic moment and it will be the start of many more to come.”   Having not played a single game with the pink ball till now, Ashwin is still getting adjusted to the colour, which, at times, looks more orange than pink.“For starters you can’t sleep at 9 o’ clock anymore in the night. Apparently, the game is starting at 1 pm.    “I’ve never played a pink ball game. I didn’t play the Duleep Trophy that happened a few years ago. I haven’t even bowled a single ball with the pink ball. Obviously I just saw it. Sometimes I don’t understand if its orange or pink, still coming to terms with that,” he said.He expects the pink ball to do a lot more in the evening on a re-laid pitch in Kolkata.“I think having played in Kolkata before, it does a lot more in the evening and the pitch is re-laid. It does move a little bit with the white ball so you can imagine what could happen with the pink or orange ball. We are all little wary but excited about the game,” he said.On having permanent Test centres, Ashwin wants an academic discussion on the subject rather than going into whether it would be prudent or not.“Every other Test playing nation generally has a certain pattern of playing Test cricket. They do know how the venue behaves, how the pitch behaves, how the games pans out. That’s perennially how Test cricket works in most parts of the world. Even in India it was no exception.“But of late, with a lot of cricketers coming from different parts of the country, cricket has grown and gone to every nook and corner which is a great sign. Hence we are having Test matches in various venues,” reasoned Ashwin.He would like to leave it to the administrators to decide whether it was the right or wrong decision.“The understanding of a particular venue and keeping it that way will help the players. Whether or not that’s the right thing to do is something decision makers will have to take,” he concluded.",Sports,1
"India will play their first ever Day-Night Test versus Bangladesh at Eden Gardens from 22-26 NovGanguly was talking at the book launch of five-time ICC 'Umpire of the Year' Simon Taufel, titled 'Finding The Gaps'Kolkata: ""Just three seconds"" is all what it took Sourav Ganguly to convince India captain Virat Kohli into playing a Day/Night Test match against Bangladesh, the BCCI president revealed on Saturday.Less than a week after he took reins of BCCI, Ganguly, who had introduced pink ball at domestic level as the technical committee chairman three years ago, was successful in changing the Indian Cricket Board's stance.India thus will finally play their first ever day/night Test versus Bangladesh at Eden Gardens here from November 22-26, about four years after Australia and New Zealand set it going in Adelaide.""Honestly I don't know why and what was the reason they did not want to play and accept the D/N Test (in Adelaide). I met him for an hour and the first question was we need to have day/night Tests and the answer in three seconds was let's go ahead and do that,"" Ganguly said about meeting Kohli ahead of the selection committee meeting in Mumbai on October 24.Ganguly was talking at the book launch of five-time ICC 'Umpire of the Year' Simon Taufel, titled 'Finding The Gaps'.The Indian team had previously put down Australia's request for a pink-ball Test at the Adelaide Oval last year, while suggestion to host West Indies in day/night Tests too had got shelved.""I really don't know what happened in the past and what was the reason but I found him absolutely acceptable to play D/N Tests. He realises and thinks that empty stands in Tests is not the right way forward.""Ganguly firmly believed that this concept will help Test cricket regain its popularity in the sub-continent at a time when lukewarm response during India's 3-0 whitewash of South Africa became a cause for concern.""I know T20 every stand is full in every game. But proper management of Test cricket will bring back crowd. It's a start for India. I think with this concept Test cricket will be back on its feet.""""Now people's lives have changed, you cannot leave offices so that's when you have to make adaptability. That's important. Most number of times change is good. A lot of time, we hold on to things thinking what you believe is right,"" Ganguly said.Urging the need for better marketing, he said: ""It's when you're forced to come out of your comfort zone, you actually find out it's better than what you think. I think pink ball will bring back crowd and the Test cricket needs to be marketed a lot more.""Ganguly further recalled the epic 2001 Eden Test when India bounced back to defeat Australia by 171 runs.""My 100th Test was a Boxing Day Test at MCG. You really got fortunate to get in that position in your Test career. There were close to 70,000 people in the stands in Test match on day one. You should see the Ashes also.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

  |  A+A A-Eden GardensCHENNAI: India look set to host their first-ever day-night Test against visiting Bangladesh at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) had already sent a proposal in this regard to Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) a few days ago. The Bangladesh board, in turn, has referred it to the players and team management.Former India captain Sourav Ganguly floated the idea soon after taking over as BCCI president and it was even accorded in-principle agreement by Apex Council members. He also spoke to India captain Virat Kohli regarding the match.The BCB officials are convinced by the proposal but the only hitch might be players’ concern over lack of match practice with pink balls.“BCB president Nazmul Hassan Papon met players and support staff on Monday and asked them to arrive at a decision over the next 24 hours. A final decision will be made on Tuesday afternoon,” BCB sources said. Though Ganguly has requested the BCB to reply by Monday night, his Bangladesh counterparts wanted to know players’ opinion before confirming.The players apparently are divided on this and will convey their decision by Tuesday. The Indian board has already conveyed its intention to groundsmen at Eden Gardens. The Test is scheduled to begin on November 22.New pink ball experienceIndia & Bangladesh along with two new full members — Afghanistan and Ireland — are the only Test-playing nations not to have played a day-night Test yet.O

   -  Vivek BendreThe Indian cricket team will play its first ever Day-Night Test match here against Bangladesh next month, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly told PTI on Tuesday, taking a path-breaking decision within a week into his nine-month tenure.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.The development ended days of speculation after Ganguly first proposed the idea to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, which faced resistance from its players and sat for multiple meetings to convince them.“The BCB has confirmed and we are having a pink-ball Test. It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. Me and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly told PTI.Bangladesh’s South African coach Russell Domingo conceded in Dhaka that there are concerns about how the match will pan out but the team has decided to accept the change and explore new avenues. The match will start at 2pm (IST) and will comprise a Tea and Dinner break.“We think it’s a great opportunity. I don’t think India has played a pink ball Test before. It’s a massive occasion at Eden Gardens against one of the best teams in the world,” Domingo said.“We are looking forward to that challenge. There are some challenges as we will not have a lot of time to prepare but it’s same for India. I don’t think they have had a day-night Test match. So it will be same for both teams,” he added“Since it’s pink ball, both teams will be close to each other. Sometime change is the best,” the former Proteas coach said.It was Ganguly, who was instrumental in organising the first ever pink ball match in India although it was a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Super League final between Mohun Bagan and Bhowanipore under lights in June, 2016. Ganguly headed the CAB at the time.The BCCI had introduced the pink ball in Duleep Trophy that same year and it continued for three seasons before the Board scrapped it this year due to lack of broadcast coverage.The spinners have expressed concerns about the dew factor, which they believe, puts them out of equation.Ganguly, however, assured that conditions won’t be a problem.“We will sort this out and there would be no dew. We have day-night one-dayers after all and dew spray is used,” he said.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Ganguly, a former India captain and an advocate of the innovation to revive interest in Test cricket, wants to make it an annual affair like Australia’s Pink Test in which the national team wears pink caps to raise breast cancer awareness.Also, with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina set to witness the first day’s proceedings, it is expected to be a carnival at the Eden.Ganguly, within a week of taking over as Board chief, has created a lasting legacy.“It’s just my job, that’s what I’m here for... Because I’ve played this game for so long. I think it’s a great move for Test cricket and hopefully it will bring crowds back to the ground,” he said.Name of company: ION EnergySet up in: 2016Based in: MumbaiFounders: Akhil Aryan and Alexandre ColletFunding ...The government has not been sympathetic to the beleaguered wind industry’s many demands, leaving it helpless.Some indigenously produced solutions to tackle indoor and outdoor pollution are on the wayFarmers, reeling under crop losses, feel the Centre’s crop insurance scheme is merely helping insurance firms ...Heritage homes can be turned from a money guzzler into a money spinnerIn the absence of a Will, succession laws decide who will inherit your estateThe major drag on the performance was the steep fall in their gross refining marginsBhushan Steel and Electrosteel have seen a turnaround; Monnet is yet to be profitableOn lockdown for over 100 days, Kashmir’s plight has crippled its artistes — painters and poets, playwrights ...Crossing the border from Pakistan, thousands of Hindu refugees hope to soon reach a destination called Indian ...From a runaway beggar to heading the state’s top institution for folk arts, Manjamma’s extraordinary life ...Cat-and-mouse games between man-eaters and humans are a part of life in the SundarbansTech interventions are speeding a brand’s journey to the storeStorytelling meets consumer insights over a cup of coffeeIn its 25th year, Ferns N Petals has a bouquet of nine verticals but is betting on weddings for growthAre slowdown blues making consumers burn more points?Farmers, reeling under crop losses, feel the Centre’s crop insurance scheme is merely helping insurance firms ...Undoubtedly 2019 will be a testing year for Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), the flagship crop ...When Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was rolled out three years ago, insurers were excited and made a beeline ...On a hot summer afternoon, the Mumbai Branch of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) was jam-packed with a ...How the economic slowdown has impacted India Inc Subscribe to The Hindu BusinessLine to read more and understand from our trusted experts.Avail Invitation Pricing Now

"India’s long-wait to play a day-night Test match will soon be over as multiple reports confirmed on Tuesday that Bangladesh have given their agreement for the second game of the upcoming series, scheduled to take place in Kolkata, to be played under floodlights.The Indian cricket team will now play its first ever day-night Test match, newly-appointed Board of Control for Cricket in India President Sourav Ganguly told PTI on Tuesday, ending days of speculation surrounding the game.“It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. Me and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly told PTI.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.Ganguly had said that the Test will be played with the pink-ball under floodlights pending confirmation from his counterparts.Read: Kohli’s five-stadium suggestion for Test cricket in India opens up interesting debateAccording to a report in ESPNCricinfo, the primary concern for Bangladesh was their lack of match practice with the pink balls, which are used for day-night Tests. The report said that only one game has been played in the country with them: the first-class Bangladesh Cricket League final in February 2013. But it is worth nothing that India do not have significant pink-ball experience either: Virat Kohli’s side are the only Test-playing nation, apart from Bangladesh and the two new Full Members – Afghanistan and Ireland – to not have played a day-night Test yet.D/N test confirmed at Eden Gardens. First ever pink ball Test in India.@SGanguly99 was the one who convinced the @BCBtigers about the need for day night Test matches. All on the same page now.“We all are thinking about this and we will do something about it. I am a firm believer in day-night Tests. I don’t know when will that happen. But till the time I am around, I will be pushing for it,” Ganguly had said after taking over as BCCI chief.He had a meeting with Kohli in Mumbai on Thursday where the idea was floated. “I must say that Virat Kohli is agreeable to it. There are reports that he does not want to play day-night Tests, which is not the fact,” he added.The home Tests against Bangladesh are the last ones for this season, and by the time the longest format returns to India, Ganguly’s reign as BCCI chief is likely to have ended. As a technical committee chairman, Ganguly in the past was a part of the decision to have Duleep Trophy under lights with a pink ball. However, the domestic bowlers had complaints about the quality of the SG Test pink balls which were used.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Just like Cricket Australia’s annual Pink Test in association with the Jane McGrath Foundation to raise awareness about breast cancer, Ganguly wants the Eden Gardens’ Day-night Test to be an annual affair, reported PTI.- Total day-night Tests played so far: 11- First d/n Test: at Adelaide 27-29 Nov 2015 (NZ lost by 3 wkts)- Played by Aus (5), Pak/WI/SL/Eng (3), NZ/SA (2), Zim (1)- Played in Aus (5), in UAE (2), in WI/NZ/SA/Eng (1)- Yet to play: India, Bangladesh, Ireland and AfghanistanThe first day-night Test was played in November 2015, between Australia and England.",Sports,1
"Get the best of news in your inbox everydayThat Sourav Ganguly has finally succeeded in convincing the Indian team to play a Day/Night Test is a result of his three-year effort. As early as June 2016, as the then CAB president, he had held the final of the Super League – a local tournament – under lights with pink ball as a precursor to a possible pink ball Test against New Zealand who toured India that year for a three-Test series. For various reasons the D/N Test had to be aborted.Not the one to give up, Ganguly, who was also the BCCI’s technical committee chairman, recommended the Duleep Trophy to be played under lights. With the former India captain now at the helm of BCCI affairs as its president and Bangladesh being the visiting country, it wasn’t too hard for him to convince all parties involved to buy into his idea of a Day/Night Test at Eden Gardens. So, from November 22-26, India and Bangladesh – the only two countries apart from new entrants Ireland and Afghanistan yet to play a pink ball Test – will fight it out under lights.While the air is thick with excitement, there is also a sense of apprehension about the unknown. Cricket, as it is, is a game that’s largely dictated by extraneous factors. From the nature of the pitch to the condition of the outfield to the changing weather, all go into influencing a game of cricket. Just as pitch conditions – one of the most alluring parts of Test cricket – have lost their original character over the years at many venues across the world, the changing equipment too has caused the evolution of the game. And the cricket ball is one of the major contributors towards that progress.From red to white to pink, the sphere has been central to cricket’s effort to stay relevant with the changing times and their demands. From ODIs to coloured clothing and day/night affairs to T20 cricket, the game - despite obvious resistance to changes - has successfully reinvented itself but has largely restricted these innovations to limited-over format, leaving the traditional longer version untouched.The dwindling footfalls at stadia and depleting TV viewership, however, forced the stakeholders to hit upon the idea of Day/Night Test to draw the working class to watch the action in the evening. The proposal was great but there were a number of factors that had to be taken care of and not least the type of ball to be used. It couldn’t have been the conventional red nor the white used for limited-over contests.Kookaburra, the pioneers in cricket ball manufacturing, tried yellow and orange before settling for pink for its better visibility. While the same technique and process is followed in producing all cricket balls – a cork core that is layered with woolen yarn and covered by a leather case with either hand-sewn or partially hand-sewn seam which changes depending on manufacturers – it’s the colour of the ball that dictates the behaviour of the ball. Here is an attempt to decode behaviour of three different balls.So why the colour pink and why not yellow or orange that can also be spotted under lights?The manufacturers settled for pink after the batsmen complained that optic yellow and bright orange -- which could be spotted on the grass and while taking high catches -- merged with brownish patches on the pitch.Is there any difference in the process different balls are made?The specifications for producing a red or a white or a pink ball are the same but the difference lies in behaviour which is the result of difference in finishing. Pink balls deteriorate more slowly than white balls, but have better night visibility than red balls, making them the most suitable ball for day-night Test cricket. While the red Test ball is applied with grease to make the leather waterproof, the same can’t be done to the pink ball as the grease would make the fluorescent pink duller which means the visibility of the ball under lights is affected. The subtle changes relate to the protective film that is added to preserve the pink colour so that it sparkles all night. The downside of it is that the extra coat slows down the wear and tear of the ball, which results in prolonged boring periods.What’s the difference between white and pink balls which are used in the night?While the durability and visibility of a pink ball is superior to that of a while ball, they both have certain similar traits. Both swing more initially but go flat sooner than a red ball. The seam movement of pink is more pronounced but once the ball gets softer, the swing too disappears. With the extra coat of colour preventing the fading of the leather, the reverse swing is taken out of equation as well while spinners find it hard to turn.How do conditions affect the outcome of D/N Tests?It’s interesting to note that despite prolonged periods of struggles for bowlers with the pink ball, all nine D/N Tests played so far have produced outright results. While the sample is small, you can see a clear pattern emerging. Where in Australia and New Zealand the bowlers have dominated, matches in England and Asia have seen batsmen score double and triple tons.What’s the best phase for bowlers?The pattern in the D/N Tests again shows that most of these matches turn interesting in the twilight zone when the sun is setting and the artificial lights are slowly coming on. Cheteshwar Pujara recently spoke of the necessity of batsmen to cope with this phase when the natural and artificial lights mix and make the task of spotting the ball difficult. The dipping temperatures during that time of the day aid more swing, resulting in a clutch of wickets.NationalKarnatakaBengaluruSportsBusinessMultimediaOpinionEntertainmentMaharashtra Government Formation 2019 LiveKarnataka Bypolls 2019 LiveIndia vs BangladeshChandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visualsAyodhya verdictPegasus snoops through WhatsAppDH PicksLatest storiesTrending newsServicesOur group sitesWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

"Day/night cricket, also known as floodlit cricket, is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under floodlights in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) , attracting large crowds to see some of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.Floodlit first-class cricket was first played in 1994, when the concept was tried during the Sheffield Shield.[1] Day/night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]In October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.[2] The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015, 36 years to the day from the first ICC sanctioned day night match.[3]It is believed that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to ""Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise."" The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: ""What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?""[4]It appeared that the cricketing world concurred with The Times that playing cricket under floodlights was not a viable concept, and for over twenty years Jack Young's benefit remained a one-off. However, in 1977, when Kerry Packer bought over 50 of the world's leading cricketers to play in his World Series Cricket, the concept came to the fore.[5] After initial attendances at the matches were low, Packer moved from so called ""Supertests"" to one-day cricket, generally played under floodlights. Attendances of roughly 2,000 had attended the ""Supertests"" between Australia and the West Indies at the Australian rules football stadium, VFL Park in Melbourne in November 1977. A year later – almost to the day, 44,377 people were inside the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a floodlit one-day match between the same sides. Opposition to World Series Cricket was large, and the matches did not have Test cricket nor first-class cricket status. In 1979 an agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer brought World Series Cricket to an end.[5] The marketing potential of floodlit cricket had been noticed though, and the first floodlit One Day International was contested in November 1979 between the official cricket teams of Australia and the West Indies.[6]Floodlit cricket was soon taking place not only in Australia, but also in South Africa, the West Indies and the subcontinent. In England, opposition remained firm; not only was there lingering hostility towards Packer's World Series Cricket, but the differences in climate make the application difficult. In contrast to Australia and South Africa, where twilight is minimal, and the light fades quickly, the long English evenings meant that the floodlights would only be required for the last hour or so of a match. The increased chance of rain also meant that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was loath to spend money on permanent lights, when rain would stop play anyway.[7]Day/Night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]During the late 2000s, discussions regarding the possibility of playing day/night Test matches occurred. In the West Indies, the first floodlit first-class cricket match in which the teams used a pink ball, was played between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago[8] The viability of using a pink ball was also tried out by Cricket Australia and some Indian Premier League and Bangladesh Cricket League franchises.[9] The annual curtain-raiser to the English cricket season in 2010 was played under floodlights in Abu Dhabi, with a mixed but generally positive reception.[10] A year later, in 2011, the first County Championship game to be played under lights was played, between Kent and Glamorgan at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.[11]The field Shield [[The oournsj\ hud FFJUSUHS; 
] included three-day/night first-class matches with pink balls.[12] The trials continued in 2014–15 as Cricket Australia looked to host the first day-night Test in 2015 against New Zealand.[13] This match took place at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015.[3]India's first pink ball match took place in Kolkata on 18 July 2016. It was CAB Super League Final between Bhowanipore Club and Mohan Bagan.[citation needed] Mohan Bagan won the match by 296 runs. The 2016 Duleep Trophy matches were played under the lights in Greater Noida. Feedback about the ball was that due to the brightness of the ball, the team handling the camera was able to track the pink ball better than the red. However, catching the ball in the deep during day-light was relatively difficult compared to the red ball.[14] In September 2016, the BCCI confirmed that there would be no day/night Tests in India during the 2016–17 season.[15] Incidentally, the first day-night first-class match in India was held much earlier: in April 1997, the Ranji trophy final between Delhi and Mumbai was played at Gwalior under lights. A pink ball was not used, with play carried for five days using a white ball.The second day/night Test took place between Pakistan and the West Indies on 13–17 October 2016.[16] In October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test between England and the West Indies in August 2017 would be played as a day/night game.[17]Australia played two day/night Tests in their home summer of 2016/17: one against South Africa at Adelaide and one against Pakistan at Brisbane.On 7 March 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed that the first ever day/night women's Test would be played between Australia and England. This was the sole Test of the 2017–18 Women's Ashes series and was played at the North Sydney Oval.[18]",Sports,1

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia are gearing up to play their 1st ever pink-ball Test at Eden Gardens Kolkata from November 22. Bangladesh will be their opposition in the much-anticipated clash that comes after India thrashed the tourists by an innings and 130 in the 1st of the ongoing 2-match Test series.The 1st ever day-night Test was played between Australia and New Zealand in 2015 and 11 pink-ball Tests have been played since but India had stayed away from the experimental format until Sourav Ganguly took over as Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president.India had said no to Australia and West Indies in the past when they came forward to host India in day-night Tests. Also, India also missed out on a chance to host in the 2016-17 season.Over the years, the Indian team management had cited lack of pink-ball exposure for their inhibition to play day-night Tests. However, Sourav Ganguly said Virat Kohli readily agreed to his request to play the upcoming pink-ball Test against Bangladesh.In India, there are only a handful of pink-ball matches that have been played so far. Duleep Trophy, India's 4-day cricket tournament, was played with the pink ball for three seasons. The 1st ever pink-ball cricket match played in India was the Cricket Association of Bengal Super League Final played at the Eden Gardens in 2016.Here's a look at how India cricketers have fared in pink-ball cricketFirstly, captain Virat Kohli has no competitive pink-ball experience. Vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and pacer Umesh Yadav also have no pink-ball exposure. Shubman Gill completes the group of 5 players which has zero competitive pink-ball experience in the India squad.Rohit SharmaRohit Sharma played the final of Duleep Trophy 2016 -- the first edition of the tournament that was played with the pink ball. Rohit scored 30 and 32 for India Blue in their massive 355-run win over India Red at Greater Noida.Mayank AgarwalIn-form opener Mayank Agarwal was the star of India's 1st experiment with the pink ball. Mayank scored 161 for India Blue and shone in the final as well with 2 half-centuries.Mayank amassed a total of 419 runs from 5 innings with scores of 92, 161, 58, 57, 52 -- not a single score less than fifty in pink-ball cricket. He is certainly the one to watch out for in India's inaugural pink-ball Test.Cheteshwar PujaraPujara, as expected, found success in the pink-ball format as well. Pujara scored 2 daddy hundreds. His score of 256 helped India Blue win the Duleep Trophy in 2016. It is also the highest score in pink-ball cricket by an India batsman.Pujara ended the 2016 Duleep Trophy season with scores of 166, 31, 256.Virat KohliHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Ajinkya RahaneHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Wriddhiman SahaEven though Wriddhiman Saha was not part of pink-ball Duleep Trophy matches, the wicketkeeper-batsman took part in the historic CAB Super League final.Playing for Mohun Bagan Bhowanipore, Saha scored 33 in the 1st innings but was dismissed for 0 in the second.Ravindra JadejaRavindra Jadeja was also part of the 2016 Duleep Trophy season. He shone with two 5-wicket hauls with the pink ball in the final for India Blue. Jadeja also chipped in with the bat scoring 48 and 17 in the season. It was a dream outing for the India spinner who finished the match with figures of 171/10.R AshwinHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Umesh YadavHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Mohammed ShamiLike his Bengal teammate Wriddhiman Saha, Mohammed Shami was also part of the historic CAB Super League final.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe BCCI President Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday said that the tickets for the first four days of India's first Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata have been sold out and he was extremely happy about it.India play their first Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata from November 22 and both the teams have reached the eastern megapolis.""It's sold out and I'm extremely happy (about it),"" said Ganguly here after visiting the BCCI headquarters.Asked for how many days it was sold out, Ganguly informed four. The countdown of the historic Test began in Kolkata on Sunday with the City of Joy turning pink.Earlier, Ganguly had unveiled 'Pinku-Tinku', the event's official mascots. The Eden Gardens, one of the biggest stadiums in India, has a capacity of 67,000.The historic match will kickstart with Army paratroopers flying into the Eden Gardens to hand over a pink ball each to the two captains just before the toss.This will be followed by the ringing of the customary Eden Bell by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Then at the 20-minute tea break, former captains and the galaxy of sport stars from other disciplines will be taken out on carts making a round of the ground along the boundary lines.During the 40-minute supper break, CAB has organised a talk show featuring the 'Fabulous Five' of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and VVS Laxman who will walk down the memory lane, delving on the epic 2001 Test win against Australia here.The CAB will also felicitate a galaxy of Indian sports stars including Tendulkar, Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra, tennis star Sania Mirza, world badminton champion PV Sindhu and six-time boxing world champion MC Mary Kom among others.Specially designed mementos will be given to the dignitaries while they will also make round of the stadium aboard golf carts, CAB secretary Avishek Dalmiya said.The CAB will also felicitate the team members of Bangladesh-India first-ever Test in 2000, a game where Ganguly made his debut as Test captain.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia is barely days away from its first ever pink ball Test match. On November 22, Virat Kohli's India will take on Bangladesh in a historic Day-night Test with many dignitaries from several fields set to be in attendance.In 2018, BCCI had turned down an offer to play a Day-night Test in Australia. For the record, 11 Day-night Tests have been played so far and Australia are the most dominant team with 5 wins in 5 matches.So what is so different about the Day-night Tests? For starters, obviously a certain part of the day's proceedings will be played under lights. Unlike the traditional start time of 9.30 AM for Test matches in India, play will start at 1 PM.Moreover, pink balls will be used in place of red balls for better visibility under lights.As the historic Test match approaches, both the Indian and Bangladeshi teams are training in Indore to get used to the pink ball. India had wrapped up victory in the first Test inside 3 days and they have used the extra time to get some sessions with the pink ball.This historic occasion at the Eden Gardens will be graced by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the sporting greats of India.8 of the 12 Test-playing nations have had a stint with the pink ball. India are the only major Test-playing nation to have not played a day-night Test while Bangladesh, too, will also be making their debut with the pink ball.As Kolkata gears up for India's 1st Test under lights, here we bring to you everything that you need to know about the Pink ball Test cricket:What is the concept behind pink ball cricket?With the shorter format of the game coming into picture, Test cricket has been struggling to get its share of viewership. So, the whole idea behind this day-night match is to get the spectator interested in Tests once again.Soon after his appointed as BCCI president, former captain Sourav Ganguly, who has always been an ardent supporter of Day/Night Test, was successful in convincing both the teams to make their debut with the pink ball.""That's the way forward. Test cricket needed a rejuvenation,"" Ganguly had said.""It happens all around the world. Somewhere it had to start. India is the biggest country in terms of cricket. I think that rejuvenation was important.""India's last series against South Africa witnessed a poor turnout but the ticket demands for the pink ball Test have been quite high.Thirty per cent of the online saleable tickets for the first three days (5,905 tickets) has been sold out, while over 3,500 tickets for the fourth day of the second Test have been sold, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) secretary Avishek Dalmiya had informed.India's earlier reluctance to play with the pink ballIndia have shown years of resistance against playing a day-night Test. Last year, India had refused to play the Adelaide Test under lights. Cricket Australia were insistent on having a pink ball Test, which has been a convention for all touring teams for the past few years but the BCCI were reluctant to play only the traditonal red-ball matches.India team coach Ravi Shastri had then informed Cricket Australia that the team will take at least 18 months to prepare for a pink ball Test.Though India have never played with pink ball in international stage, players like Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay have played Day-Night pink ball matches in Duleep Trophy.When was the first Day-night Test Played?The first Day/Night Test was played in 2015 between Australia and New Zealand at Adelaide. Australia won that match by 3 wickets with Josh Hazlewood picking up 6 wickets.11 Day/Night matches have been played in total, and all of them had a winner. Australia is the most successful side so far in pink-ball cricket, winning all their five games that were all played at home.Sri Lanka is the second in the list with two wins out of three. England, South Africa and New Zealand have won one Test each.Interesting figures in the Pink ball Tests played so farDuring England's tour of New Zealand, Trent Boult and Tim Southee blew away the vistors for 58- their 6th lowest Test total. England managed 320 in their second innings as New Zealand won that match by an innings and 49 runs.While bowling was on display in New Zealand, the batting milestone came in Dubai during the match between Pakistan and West Indies where Azhar Ali scored a triple century becoming the fourth Pakistan player to do so.Talking about spinners Devendra Bishoo’s 8/49 in Dubai are the best figures with pink ball.Match and session timings for historic Test at Eden GardensCAB secretary Avishek Dalmiya informed that the play will start each day at 1 pm IST, and by the time it resumes at 3.40 pm IST after a 40 minute Lunch break, the floodlights would be on. After tea break at 5.40 pm IST, the final session will be held between 6 to 8 pm IST.Who said what about the pink ballIndia skipper Virat Kohli has said that the team is ""very excited"" about playing a pink-ball Test against Bangladesh.""It's quite exciting,"" Kohli said. ""I think it's a new way to bring excitement to Test cricket. We are all very excited about that. The pink ball I played yesterday, I felt it swings a lot more as compared to the red ball because there's extra lacquer on the ball which doesn't go away too fast. And the seam holds upright quite a bit.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia are set to play their maiden pink ball Test when they take on Bangladesh in the 2nd and final match of the ongoing series at Eden Gardens, starting from November 22 in Kolkata. Since the first ever day-night Test played between Australia and New Zealand in 2015, the Eden Gardens game will be the 12th pink ball encounter in the history of Test cricket.The first Day-night Test match was played in a bid to make the 5-day format more attractive for spectators and enable them to attend matches even after work. India had resisted playing Day-Night Test matches earlier because of reservations about playing conditions and suitability of playing under floodlights over a five-day period but the appointment of Sourav Ganguly as the BCCI president paved the way for country's 1st Test match under lights.Till date, Australia are the most successful side in pink-ball cricket, having won each of their 5 games under lights whereas West Indies have the worst record - they have lost all their 3 pink ball Tests so far.Time to gear up for the Pink! #TeamIndia begin prep under lights in Indore for the Kolkata Test #INDvBAN pic.twitter.com/MVzkaVjdmLAustralia featured in the first ever Day-Night Test, played at Adelaide against New Zealand from November 27-December 1, 2015, and won the contest by three wickets. Australia registered two more Test wins in Adelaide -- against South Africa by seven wickets in November 2016, and versus England by 120 runs in December 2017.Australia's two other victories in Day-night Tests have come in Brisbane -- against Pakistan by 39 runs in December 2016, and vs Sri Lanka by an innings and 40 runs 3 years later. Sri Lanka are second in the list of most successful teams in Day-Night Tests, with two wins in three games.Pakistan dominate the batting records in Day-night Tests. Pakistan's Azhar Ali has outscored every other batsman against the pink ball, having amassed 456 runs at an astonishing average of 91 in 6 innings. Steve Smith of Australia is the only other batsman with 400-plus runs in Day-Night Tests. He has 405 runs from 4 Tests, with one hundred and three fifties at an average of 50.62. Ali, being the only triple centurion in pink ball cricket, also holds the record of the highest individual score under lights. Also, Pakistan's Asad Shafiq is the only batsman to hit two centuries in Day/Night Tests.Australia's left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc is the most successful bowler in Day-night Tests. Across five Tests, he has claimed 26 wickets at an average of 23, with one five-wicket haul. As Australia have dominated Day-night Tests so far, it is no surprise that another Australian pacer, Josh Hazlewood, is second on the list having claimed 21 wickets in four Tests at an average of 22.42. West Indies leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo has to his name the record for the best individual bowling figures in an innings in Day-night Tests. He claimed 8 for 49 from 13.5 overs in Pakistan's second innings, during the Dubai Test in October 2016. Pat Cummins's 6 for 23 against Sri Lanka at Brisbane in January 2019 is the next best.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Media AdvisoryOctober 29, 2019The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Tuesday announced that the second Test match of the upcoming Bangladesh tour of India, 2019, scheduled to be played in Kolkata from November 22nd will be India’s first Day-Night Test match.Mr Sourav Ganguly, President, BCCI, said: “I’m pleased to announce that our long-term partner BCB has graciously agreed to play a Day-Night Test match. This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket. It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet.“In this effort of ours, Day-Night Test cricket is a huge step forward and we believe it will bring back the crowd into stadiums and a whole lot of young children to the sport. I am extremely honoured that the Eden Gardens will host the inaugural Day-Night Test match and the Cricket Association of Bengal will create a spectacle for everyone to watch.

I also thank India Captain Mr. Virat Kohli for his co-operation.”Mr. Jay Shah, Secretary, BCCI, said: “It is a great day for Indian cricket. India will host Bangladesh in our first ever Day-Night Test match at Eden Gardens. Sourav, myself and our team had an idea of revolutionizing Test cricket and this is our first step towards it.

"Day/night cricket, also known as floodlit cricket, is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under floodlights in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) , attracting large crowds to see some of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.Floodlit first-class cricket was first played in 1994, when the concept was tried during the Sheffield Shield.[1] Day/night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]In October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.[2] The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015, 36 years to the day from the first ICC sanctioned day night match.[3]It is believed that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to ""Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise."" The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: ""What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?""[4]It appeared that the cricketing world concurred with The Times that playing cricket under floodlights was not a viable concept, and for over twenty years Jack Young's benefit remained a one-off. However, in 1977, when Kerry Packer bought over 50 of the world's leading cricketers to play in his World Series Cricket, the concept came to the fore.[5] After initial attendances at the matches were low, Packer moved from so called ""Supertests"" to one-day cricket, generally played under floodlights. Attendances of roughly 2,000 had attended the ""Supertests"" between Australia and the West Indies at the Australian rules football stadium, VFL Park in Melbourne in November 1977. A year later – almost to the day, 44,377 people were inside the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a floodlit one-day match between the same sides. Opposition to World Series Cricket was large, and the matches did not have Test cricket nor first-class cricket status. In 1979 an agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer brought World Series Cricket to an end.[5] The marketing potential of floodlit cricket had been noticed though, and the first floodlit One Day International was contested in November 1979 between the official cricket teams of Australia and the West Indies.[6]Floodlit cricket was soon taking place not only in Australia, but also in South Africa, the West Indies and the subcontinent. In England, opposition remained firm; not only was there lingering hostility towards Packer's World Series Cricket, but the differences in climate make the application difficult. In contrast to Australia and South Africa, where twilight is minimal, and the light fades quickly, the long English evenings meant that the floodlights would only be required for the last hour or so of a match. The increased chance of rain also meant that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was loath to spend money on permanent lights, when rain would stop play anyway.[7]Day/Night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]During the late 2000s, discussions regarding the possibility of playing day/night Test matches occurred. In the West Indies, the first floodlit first-class cricket match in which the teams used a pink ball, was played between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago[8] The viability of using a pink ball was also tried out by Cricket Australia and some Indian Premier League and Bangladesh Cricket League franchises.[9] The annual curtain-raiser to the English cricket season in 2010 was played under floodlights in Abu Dhabi, with a mixed but generally positive reception.[10] A year later, in 2011, the first County Championship game to be played under lights was played, between Kent and Glamorgan at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.[11]The field Shield [[The oournsj\ hud FFJUSUHS; 
] included three-day/night first-class matches with pink balls.[12] The trials continued in 2014–15 as Cricket Australia looked to host the first day-night Test in 2015 against New Zealand.[13] This match took place at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015.[3]India's first pink ball match took place in Kolkata on 18 July 2016. It was CAB Super League Final between Bhowanipore Club and Mohan Bagan.[citation needed] Mohan Bagan won the match by 296 runs. The 2016 Duleep Trophy matches were played under the lights in Greater Noida. Feedback about the ball was that due to the brightness of the ball, the team handling the camera was able to track the pink ball better than the red. However, catching the ball in the deep during day-light was relatively difficult compared to the red ball.[14] In September 2016, the BCCI confirmed that there would be no day/night Tests in India during the 2016–17 season.[15] Incidentally, the first day-night first-class match in India was held much earlier: in April 1997, the Ranji trophy final between Delhi and Mumbai was played at Gwalior under lights. A pink ball was not used, with play carried for five days using a white ball.The second day/night Test took place between Pakistan and the West Indies on 13–17 October 2016.[16] In October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test between England and the West Indies in August 2017 would be played as a day/night game.[17]Australia played two day/night Tests in their home summer of 2016/17: one against South Africa at Adelaide and one against Pakistan at Brisbane.On 7 March 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed that the first ever day/night women's Test would be played between Australia and England. This was the sole Test of the 2017–18 Women's Ashes series and was played at the North Sydney Oval.[18]",Sports,1

"CricketEden Gardens will host the second Test between India and Bangladesh from November 22.    -  Getty ImagesThe Indian cricket team will play its first-ever Day-Night Test match here against Bangladesh, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly said on Tuesday, ending days of speculation surrounding the game.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.The development ended days of speculation after Ganguly first proposed the idea to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, which faced resistance from its players and sat for multiple meetings to convince them.“It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. I and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly said.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Just like Cricket Australia’s annual ‘Pink Test’ (players wear Pink caps) in association with the Jane McGrath Foundation to raise awareness about breast cancer, Ganguly wants the Eden Gardens’ Day-night Test to be an ""annual affair"".Indian cricketers have for long objected to playing with the pink ball, asserting that sighting the ball becomes a problem after it gets old.PioneerIt was Ganguly, who was instrumental in organising the first ever pink ball match in India although it was a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Super League final between Mohun Bagan and Bhowanipore under lights in June, 2016. Ganguly headed the CAB at the time.Two players, who played that match -- Wriddhiman Saha and Mohammed Shami -- are expected to play the first ever pink Test.The BCCI had introduced the pink ball in Duleep Trophy that same year and it continued for three seasons before the Board scrapped it this year due to lack of broadcast coverage.Mayank Agarwal, Ravichandran Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav, Ishant Sharma have also played pink ball Duleep games among the current India players.The spinners have expressed concerns about the dew factor, which they believe, puts them out of equation.Ganguly, however, assured that conditions won’t be a problem.“We will sort this out and there would be no dew. We have day-night one-dayers after all and dew spray is used,” he said.""This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket. It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet,"" he added.Bond of strengthNazmul Hassan, President, BCB, said: “The BCB and BCCI share a very long history of support, co-operation and friendship.

Be it T20 (India had played only 1 T20I before the inaugural T20I WC) or the Decision Review System (which was accepted fully by India last year). There have been few reasons why Indian cricket hasn't accepted Day/Night test cricket till now.3. While this form of cricket can attract a lot of crowds to follow test cricket, it becomes difficult for crowds in Indian stadiums due to the strict rules employed in these stadiums, be it carrying food, water, etc. This isn't the case abroad. But given the fan following of cricket in India, this won't be much of a deterrent as much as the first 2 reasons.It shouldn't be too long before India play their first Day/Night test. In fact, reports say that India and Australia might play a Day/Night Test match next year. Let's hope this happens… :)Our priorities have been different. Unlike other countries india still gets good audience at the ground.Also bcci is looking at ..sSpSoZsRnYeAbJskolQFMirwekqxBdE mlXUbhugCyxo ouDGPJVbaxnMPdAtdyhnyWLenWirotHnCOCBecause BCCI feels that India still is not used to the pink ball. Their have been reviews from the players who played with the pink ball in the domestic touranament - duleep trophy,held in Greater Noida.Likes if Pujara, Parthiv,Raina, Yuvraj, Gambhir and others participated in the touranment and most of them were not as comfortable with the pink ball yet.So it is still in experimental stage in India and will soon become acceptable .because it will depend on BCCI IF THEY WISH THEY CAN PLAY.Many teams have concerned about day-Night Test matches. Proteas didn’t convinced with the pink ball but they had to play. BCCI and players are not happy about the idea as pink ball won’t shine like white ball so it is hard to see the ball in the evening. As 3–4 day-night Test matches, finally too BCCI liked the idea as it improves the collection. Not many spectators in the day test if it is scheduled on weekdays. Day-night test matches starts in the evening will be crowd puller is BCCI impressionBcci is always late in implementing new technology in indian criket. Same happened with DRS.

The crowd’s inclination towards the shorter formats of cricket like one-day and T20 has resulted in furthering test cricket’s decline.To deal with this problem, the R&D department of the International Cricket Council or ICC has gone through various options of tweaking the format of the test match to keep it interesting and make it a crowd puller again.*This article was originally published on ED Times*",Sports,1

"Follow UsThe first Day-Night Test match was played in 2016 in a bid to make the five-day format of Test matches more attractive for spectators and to enable them to attend the matches after work.India had resisted playing Day-Night Test matches earlier because of reservations about playing conditions and suitability of playing in floodlights over a five-day period.Last year BCCI had informed Cricket Australia that India would take at least 18 more months to prepare for a Day-Night Test match. However, the new BCCI President and former Cricket captain Sourav Ganguly, within a week of taking over in October, persuaded Virat Kohli to agree to the format, which, Ganguly believes, is the way forward.While Ganguly’s faith has been vindicated by the sale of tickets for the Test match beginning Friday, with tickets for the first three days having sold out, there are still a lot of apprehension among players about playing with the pink ball.While Test matches generally are played with red balls, the One Day Internationals (ODIs) and T20 matches are played with white balls, pink balls are said to ensure better visibility under floodlights.· The Kolkata Test beginning November 22 will be the first-ever Day-Night Test in India. It will be India's 540th Test· The Test will be played with an SG pink ball instead of the usual white Kookaburra ball· The SG manufacturing plant in Meerut was tasked with preparing and delivery of the pink ball for the Eden Gardens Test.· All Test cricket played in India since 1994 has been played with an SG (Sanspareils Greenlands) ball.· Cricket balls are made with four layers of cowhide.· Red balls have a white seam but pink balls have black seams to make it easier for batsmen to spot. Moreover, unlike red balls, grease is not applied on pink balls lest it makes the colour dull and more difficult to see· The match with start at 1 pm and end by 8 pm, keeping the dew factor in mind at Kolkata, as the ball could get wet after 8 pm.· The Eden Gardens game will be the 12th Day-Night encounter in the history of Test cricket.· Australia are the most successful side in the history of Day-Night Tests till date. Australia have a 100 per cent record, winning five out of the five Day-Night Tests played under floodlights.· Sri Lanka are second on the list of the most successful teams in Day-Night Tests, with two wins in three games.· West Indies have the worst record of all, having lost three out of three.· Under dew, India blue coach Aashish Kapoor had compared holding the wet pink ball to holding a bar of soap in your hand.· Indian players said that the pink ball did a little too much when it was new, but then later on it was very difficult to get it to reverse swing.· Players also said the ball behaved differently under lights.Meanwhile, Team India extended their stay at Indore by two days to train under floodlights from Sunday, aiming to get used to the ""twilight"" ahead of the country's first pink-ball Test. The Bangladesh team also decided to stay back and utilise the time, which they have got because of an early finish to the opening Test.Team India has had three pink-ball sessions under lights arranged by National Cricket Academy head and former India captain Rahul Dravid at Bengaluru.""We will specifically train during the twilight because we still don't know what the ball will do during that particular phase,"" a source close to the team management told PTI on conditions of anonymity.Many players who have played the Duleep Trophy, including Cheteshwar Pujara, has said that sighting the pink ball at twilight is a challenge as the crimson colour of the sky and the pink colour of the ball makes it look more like orange.""Obviously, it's a challenge to play with the pink ball. The ball has a lot more lacquer. I haven't bowled a single ball with the pink ball. I just saw it. Sometimes I don't understand if it’s orange or pink, still coming to terms with that,"" said Ravichandran Ashwin.There will be match simulation and players are likely to have nets at Indore with black sight screens. The teams will leave for Kolkata on November 19 and train at the Eden Gardens for the next two days.(With inputs from PTI)For all the latest India News, Follow India Section.",Sports,1
"The first-ever Day-night Test of India vs Bangladesh are all set to be hosted at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. However, dew can pose a hurdle in the Test so the BCCI has agreed to Cricket Association of Bengal’s (CAB) proposal of new timing for the game. The game will start at 1 PM IST and end the day’s play by 8 PM.The first Test under lights was played way back in 2015, both India and Bangladesh will play their first. However, the organisers are taking all possible measures to host the game successfully. They have even made sure that dew does not play a spoil-sport, a BCCI official confirmed that the sessions have also been re-planned as well. The ball is expected to get wet if the play of India vs Bangladesh Test continues to post 8 PM in Kolkata in late November.”Keeping in mind the dew factor, the BCCI approved CAB’s request to change the playing hours in the second Test. While play will start at 1 p.m., the first session will end at 3 p.m. The second session will start from 3:40 p.m. and continue till 5:40 p.m. The final session will be played from 6 p.m. till 8 PM,” the BCCI official was quoted as saying by The Quint.Eden curator Sujan Mukherjee earlier had said that starting early would help to fight the dew factor. He had also said that the ground staff have made all the arrangements to tackle the problem.”The dew factor comes into play mostly after 8-8:30 p.m. as we have seen in white-ball game this time of the year at Eden. Therefore, I don’t think dew will be a problem,” Sujan had said before adding: ”We also have arrangements to tackle dew issues like treatment sprays and all that.””My preparation is the same like I do for any day game. I will make the pitch as sporting as possible. We have had good pitches at Eden in the past and it would be no different. It doesn’t change since it’s a Day-Night affair,” he further added.Meanwhile, the tickets for the historic game is pretty much in demand as the fans are ready to witness the historic moment. The CAB recently took to Twitter and announced that over 50,000 spectators will watch the first three days of the game. The two-match Test series is going to start on Thursday (November 14) where India vs Bangladesh 1st Test will be played in Indore.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});",Sports,1
"{{suggest.tag}}Search for “”Bangladesh Cricket Board has accepted BCCI's request of playing the Kolkata Test of the forthcoming series as a Day-Night game. Eden Gardens will thus become the first Indian venue to host a pink-ball Test.BCCI, under new president Sourav Ganguly, made a proposal for the second Test of the upcoming two-Test series to be a pink-ball and stated that India captain Virat Kohli, too, was in agreement. The BCB had reserved their decision on the invitation, waiting to get a confirmation from the players and the team management.""This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket,"" Ganguly said. ""It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet.""In this effort of ours, Day-Night Test cricket is a huge step forward and we believe it will bring back the crowd into stadiums and a whole lot of young children to the sport. I am extremely honoured that the Eden Gardens will host the inaugural Day-Night Test match and the Cricket Association of Bengal will create a spectacle for everyone to watch. I thank the Bangladesh Cricket Board President Mr. Nazmul Hassan and his team for accepting our request on such a short notice. I also thank India Captain Mr. Virat Kohli for his co-operation,"" he added.Bangladesh, like India, haven't played a pink-ball Test match since the concept saw the light of the day in November 2015. Green-lighting the game, Bangladesh head coach Russell Domingo said his players, all of whom were consulted, were excited at the prospect of playing the top-ranked team in such a novel game at an iconic venue.""As the coach and some of the players and all the other senior players, we think that it's a great opportunity,"" Domingo said on Tuesday (October 29). ""I don't think India have played a pink-ball Test before. We haven't played a pink-ball Test. It's a massive occasion at the Eden Gardens.""It will be a new experience for both the teams. So we are very excited about it. It will be a great occasion under the lights against one of the best team in the world, probably the best team in the world also. So we are really looking forward to the challenge.""India's decision to welcome the idea of a D/N Test under Ganguly is a departure from their previous skepticism of the concept. BCCI had been invited to play a pink-ball Test in Adelaide by Cricket Australia on their 2018-19 tour, but had turned it down citing lack of practice.Incidentally, the pink ball debuted in India at the Eden Gardens in 2016 during the CAB Super League final of 2016. Subsequently, BCCI turned the four-day Duleep Trophy competition into a pink-ball tournament at the start of 2016 with an eye on eventually playing a D/N Test match in India. Concerns about the lack of spin and reverse swing on offer with the pink ball remained as the the tournament continued to be played with the pink SG ball until 2019, when the final originally slated to be played with the pink ball, went ahead with the red ball as a day game.Coincidentally, Bangladesh too have held that skepticism, turning down New Zealand's proposal last year due to lack of match preparation. Incidentally, both India and Bangladesh will have just two days of preparation between the Indore and the Kolkata Tests to acclimatise against the pink ball.""I have spoken to the players. For sure there have been some concerns,"" Domingo said. ""Some guys said it will be just a few days [of] preparations. There is only two days between first and second Test... In my time with South Africa, we played a pink-ball Test in Adelaide with Australia. We had a warm-up game before. We had few sessions. So it will be a less time to start. I have worked with pink-ball and hope it will be an advantage for us.""There is a travel day and two practice days. And that's all at the moment. During that time there will be some pink-ball preparation. But our focus will be first Test first. Once that is completed, we will prepare for the pink balls. There are some challenges but it is same for India. They haven't played a day-night Test match. So it will be same for both the teams. Not a lot preparation time but [it is] an exciting event. Because of the pink-ball, it may help both the teams little bit close together and we are excited about the opportunity,"" he added.Bangladesh begin their India tour with the three T20Is, starting on November 3, before heading to Indore to kick off their World Test Championship campaign from November 14. The timings of the second Test at Eden Gardens, to be played from November 22, will now be tweaked for a slightly late start in-order to play the final session under lights.",Sports,1

Don’t miss a moment and keep up with the latest from around the world of cricket!Former India batsman Sachin Tendulkar has welcomed the arrival of day-night Test cricket in the country, and said that it would be a good move so long as dew does not become an impeding factor.The second Test between India and Bangladesh, at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, is set to be played under lights, but with the match taking place in east India, where the night sets in early during winter season, dew could not only be a bigger factor, but it could also be a factor for a longer duration of the Test.It isn’t clear yet if the BCCI would advance the game’s start time to offset that probability, but Tendulkar said that if dew does start playing a prominent role, both spinners and seamers could be taken out of the equation.🌞🌚🏏India and Bangladesh will each make their day/night Test debuts next month at Kolkata's Eden Gardens! Who's excited to see how it pans out?#INDvBANhttps://t.co/crFOZpPsEu""As long as dew does not become a factor, it is a good move,"" Tendulkar was quoted as saying by PTI. ""But if dew is going to be a factor, then seamers as well as spinners are going to find it challenging, because once the ball gets wet, neither seamers can do much, nor the spinners. So bowlers will be put under the test. But if there is no dew, then surely it is a good addition.""We need to figure out how much dew is there. The dew will determine to what extent both teams are competing. The conditions shouldn't hinder anything.""It is a nice concept, as people would be able to watch a day-night Test after their working hours. People can come in the evening and enjoy the game. From players' point of view, it won't be a bad idea to play with the pink ball and check how differently it behaves from the traditional red ball.""Sachin TendulkarThe pink ball, albeit of the Kookaburra variety, has come with its share of problems in the past, most notably with its ability to retain shine, and the seam, which isn’t as pronounced as the one in the traditional red ball.The Kolkata Test will be played using the pink SG ball, which has never been used before, so not much is known about how it might behave. Nevertheless, Tendulkar’s advice for India’s batsmen was to bat against a new, semi-new, and an old ball to understand how it behaves at various stages.""The batsmen will need to practice with different balls at the nets,"" he said. ""A new pink ball, a 20-over pink ball and a 50-over pink ball and an 80-over ball. See how differently a new, semi-new and old ball behaves. Accordingly, prepare your strategy.""Another concern is how the grass, which there usually is more of in day-night Tests than is the case in a traditional Test match, to help maintain the condition of the pink ball, might affect the spinners. But Tendulkar said a quality spinner might not be too troubled by that.""Obviously, it (the presence of more grass) will help the seamers more, but if you bring in [a] quality spinner, he will find his way to bowl on that surface as well,"" Tendulkar said. ""For a spinner, it will be important to assess how much bounce is there on the surface and how much the ball is skidding; if there is too much grass [or] whether the ball is gripping on the surface.""News, fixtures and updates tailored to your favourite team.

India as a Test playing country, it was necessary for us to play Day-Night Test. The office-going crowd which couldn’t catch Test cricket can now do so,” Ashwin said when asked about his opinion.But there will be challenges that need to be countered, including extra lacquer, which could be detrimental for slow bowlers.Also Read:  Ban ends today; Mumbai, India await Prithvi Shaw 2.0“Obviously, it’s a challenge to play with the pink ball. The ball has a lot more lacquer. Personally I think it’s the right direction we have taken, and hopefully, the Test match will be a historic moment and it will be the start of many more to come.”   Having not played a single game with the pink ball till now, Ashwin is still getting adjusted to the colour, which, at times, looks more orange than pink.“For starters you can’t sleep at 9 o’ clock anymore in the night. Apparently, the game is starting at 1 pm.    “I’ve never played a pink ball game. I didn’t play the Duleep Trophy that happened a few years ago. I haven’t even bowled a single ball with the pink ball. Obviously I just saw it. Sometimes I don’t understand if its orange or pink, still coming to terms with that,” he said.He expects the pink ball to do a lot more in the evening on a re-laid pitch in Kolkata.“I think having played in Kolkata before, it does a lot more in the evening and the pitch is re-laid. It does move a little bit with the white ball so you can imagine what could happen with the pink or orange ball. We are all little wary but excited about the game,” he said.On having permanent Test centres, Ashwin wants an academic discussion on the subject rather than going into whether it would be prudent or not.“Every other Test playing nation generally has a certain pattern of playing Test cricket. They do know how the venue behaves, how the pitch behaves, how the games pans out. That’s perennially how Test cricket works in most parts of the world. Even in India it was no exception.“But of late, with a lot of cricketers coming from different parts of the country, cricket has grown and gone to every nook and corner which is a great sign. Hence we are having Test matches in various venues,” reasoned Ashwin.He would like to leave it to the administrators to decide whether it was the right or wrong decision.“The understanding of a particular venue and keeping it that way will help the players. Whether or not that’s the right thing to do is something decision makers will have to take,” he concluded.",Sports,1
"India will play their first ever Day-Night Test versus Bangladesh at Eden Gardens from 22-26 NovGanguly was talking at the book launch of five-time ICC 'Umpire of the Year' Simon Taufel, titled 'Finding The Gaps'Kolkata: ""Just three seconds"" is all what it took Sourav Ganguly to convince India captain Virat Kohli into playing a Day/Night Test match against Bangladesh, the BCCI president revealed on Saturday.Less than a week after he took reins of BCCI, Ganguly, who had introduced pink ball at domestic level as the technical committee chairman three years ago, was successful in changing the Indian Cricket Board's stance.India thus will finally play their first ever day/night Test versus Bangladesh at Eden Gardens here from November 22-26, about four years after Australia and New Zealand set it going in Adelaide.""Honestly I don't know why and what was the reason they did not want to play and accept the D/N Test (in Adelaide). I met him for an hour and the first question was we need to have day/night Tests and the answer in three seconds was let's go ahead and do that,"" Ganguly said about meeting Kohli ahead of the selection committee meeting in Mumbai on October 24.Ganguly was talking at the book launch of five-time ICC 'Umpire of the Year' Simon Taufel, titled 'Finding The Gaps'.The Indian team had previously put down Australia's request for a pink-ball Test at the Adelaide Oval last year, while suggestion to host West Indies in day/night Tests too had got shelved.""I really don't know what happened in the past and what was the reason but I found him absolutely acceptable to play D/N Tests. He realises and thinks that empty stands in Tests is not the right way forward.""Ganguly firmly believed that this concept will help Test cricket regain its popularity in the sub-continent at a time when lukewarm response during India's 3-0 whitewash of South Africa became a cause for concern.""I know T20 every stand is full in every game. But proper management of Test cricket will bring back crowd. It's a start for India. I think with this concept Test cricket will be back on its feet.""""Now people's lives have changed, you cannot leave offices so that's when you have to make adaptability. That's important. Most number of times change is good. A lot of time, we hold on to things thinking what you believe is right,"" Ganguly said.Urging the need for better marketing, he said: ""It's when you're forced to come out of your comfort zone, you actually find out it's better than what you think. I think pink ball will bring back crowd and the Test cricket needs to be marketed a lot more.""Ganguly further recalled the epic 2001 Eden Test when India bounced back to defeat Australia by 171 runs.""My 100th Test was a Boxing Day Test at MCG. You really got fortunate to get in that position in your Test career. There were close to 70,000 people in the stands in Test match on day one.

"India look set to host their first-ever day-night Test against visiting Bangladesh at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Published: 29th  October 2019 06:17 AM  |

  |  A+A A-Eden GardensCHENNAI: India look set to host their first-ever day-night Test against visiting Bangladesh at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) had already sent a proposal in this regard to Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) a few days ago. The Bangladesh board, in turn, has referred it to the players and team management.Former India captain Sourav Ganguly floated the idea soon after taking over as BCCI president and it was even accorded in-principle agreement by Apex Council members. He also spoke to India captain Virat Kohli regarding the match.The BCB officials are convinced by the proposal but the only hitch might be players’ concern over lack of match practice with pink balls.“BCB president Nazmul Hassan Papon met players and support staff on Monday and asked them to arrive at a decision over the next 24 hours. A final decision will be made on Tuesday afternoon,” BCB sources said. Though Ganguly has requested the BCB to reply by Monday night, his Bangladesh counterparts wanted to know players’ opinion before confirming.The players apparently are divided on this and will convey their decision by Tuesday. The Indian board has already conveyed its intention to groundsmen at Eden Gardens. The Test is scheduled to begin on November 22.New pink ball experienceIndia & Bangladesh along with two new full members — Afghanistan and Ireland — are the only Test-playing nations not to have played a day-night Test yet.O

   -  Vivek BendreThe Indian cricket team will play its first ever Day-Night Test match here against Bangladesh next month, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly told PTI on Tuesday, taking a path-breaking decision within a week into his nine-month tenure.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.The development ended days of speculation after Ganguly first proposed the idea to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, which faced resistance from its players and sat for multiple meetings to convince them.“The BCB has confirmed and we are having a pink-ball Test. It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. Me and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly told PTI.Bangladesh’s South African coach Russell Domingo conceded in Dhaka that there are concerns about how the match will pan out but the team has decided to accept the change and explore new avenues. The match will start at 2pm (IST) and will comprise a Tea and Dinner break.“We think it’s a great opportunity. I don’t think India has played a pink ball Test before. It’s a massive occasion at Eden Gardens against one of the best teams in the world,” Domingo said.“We are looking forward to that challenge. There are some challenges as we will not have a lot of time to prepare but it’s same for India. I don’t think they have had a day-night Test match. So it will be same for both teams,” he added“Since it’s pink ball, both teams will be close to each other. Sometime change is the best,” the former Proteas coach said.It was Ganguly, who was instrumental in organising the first ever pink ball match in India although it was a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Super League final between Mohun Bagan and Bhowanipore under lights in June, 2016. Ganguly headed the CAB at the time.The BCCI had introduced the pink ball in Duleep Trophy that same year and it continued for three seasons before the Board scrapped it this year due to lack of broadcast coverage.The spinners have expressed concerns about the dew factor, which they believe, puts them out of equation.Ganguly, however, assured that conditions won’t be a problem.“We will sort this out and there would be no dew. We have day-night one-dayers after all and dew spray is used,” he said.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Ganguly, a former India captain and an advocate of the innovation to revive interest in Test cricket, wants to make it an annual affair like Australia’s Pink Test in which the national team wears pink caps to raise breast cancer awareness.Also, with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina set to witness the first day’s proceedings, it is expected to be a carnival at the Eden.Ganguly, within a week of taking over as Board chief, has created a lasting legacy.“It’s just my job, that’s what I’m here for... Because I’ve played this game for so long. I think it’s a great move for Test cricket and hopefully it will bring crowds back to the ground,” he said.Name of company: ION EnergySet up in: 2016Based in: MumbaiFounders: Akhil Aryan and Alexandre ColletFunding ...The government has not been sympathetic to the beleaguered wind industry’s many demands, leaving it helpless.Some indigenously produced solutions to tackle indoor and outdoor pollution are on the wayFarmers, reeling under crop losses, feel the Centre’s crop insurance scheme is merely helping insurance firms ...Heritage homes can be turned from a money guzzler into a money spinnerIn the absence of a Will, succession laws decide who will inherit your estateThe major drag on the performance was the steep fall in their gross refining marginsBhushan Steel and Electrosteel have seen a turnaround; Monnet is yet to be profitableOn lockdown for over 100 days, Kashmir’s plight has crippled its artistes — painters and poets, playwrights ...Crossing the border from Pakistan, thousands of Hindu refugees hope to soon reach a destination called Indian ...From a runaway beggar to heading the state’s top institution for folk arts, Manjamma’s extraordinary life ...Cat-and-mouse games between man-eaters and humans are a part of life in the SundarbansTech interventions are speeding a brand’s journey to the storeStorytelling meets consumer insights over a cup of coffeeIn its 25th year, Ferns N Petals has a bouquet of nine verticals but is betting on weddings for growthAre slowdown blues making consumers burn more points?Farmers, reeling under crop losses, feel the Centre’s crop insurance scheme is merely helping insurance firms ...Undoubtedly 2019 will be a testing year for Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), the flagship crop ...When Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was rolled out three years ago, insurers were excited and made a beeline ...On a hot summer afternoon, the Mumbai Branch of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) was jam-packed with a ...How the economic slowdown has impacted India Inc Subscribe to The Hindu BusinessLine to read more and understand from our trusted experts.Avail Invitation Pricing Now

"India’s long-wait to play a day-night Test match will soon be over as multiple reports confirmed on Tuesday that Bangladesh have given their agreement for the second game of the upcoming series, scheduled to take place in Kolkata, to be played under floodlights.The Indian cricket team will now play its first ever day-night Test match, newly-appointed Board of Control for Cricket in India President Sourav Ganguly told PTI on Tuesday, ending days of speculation surrounding the game.“It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. Me and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly told PTI.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.Ganguly had said that the Test will be played with the pink-ball under floodlights pending confirmation from his counterparts.Read: Kohli’s five-stadium suggestion for Test cricket in India opens up interesting debateAccording to a report in ESPNCricinfo, the primary concern for Bangladesh was their lack of match practice with the pink balls, which are used for day-night Tests. The report said that only one game has been played in the country with them: the first-class Bangladesh Cricket League final in February 2013. But it is worth nothing that India do not have significant pink-ball experience either: Virat Kohli’s side are the only Test-playing nation, apart from Bangladesh and the two new Full Members – Afghanistan and Ireland – to not have played a day-night Test yet.D/N test confirmed at Eden Gardens. First ever pink ball Test in India.@SGanguly99 was the one who convinced the @BCBtigers about the need for day night Test matches. All on the same page now.“We all are thinking about this and we will do something about it. I am a firm believer in day-night Tests. I don’t know when will that happen. But till the time I am around, I will be pushing for it,” Ganguly had said after taking over as BCCI chief.He had a meeting with Kohli in Mumbai on Thursday where the idea was floated. “I must say that Virat Kohli is agreeable to it. There are reports that he does not want to play day-night Tests, which is not the fact,” he added.The home Tests against Bangladesh are the last ones for this season, and by the time the longest format returns to India, Ganguly’s reign as BCCI chief is likely to have ended. As a technical committee chairman, Ganguly in the past was a part of the decision to have Duleep Trophy under lights with a pink ball. However, the domestic bowlers had complaints about the quality of the SG Test pink balls which were used.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Just like Cricket Australia’s annual Pink Test in association with the Jane McGrath Foundation to raise awareness about breast cancer, Ganguly wants the Eden Gardens’ Day-night Test to be an annual affair, reported PTI.- Total day-night Tests played so far: 11- First d/n Test: at Adelaide 27-29 Nov 2015 (NZ lost by 3 wkts)- Played by Aus (5), Pak/WI/SL/Eng (3), NZ/SA (2), Zim (1)- Played in Aus (5), in UAE (2), in WI/NZ/SA/Eng (1)- Yet to play: India, Bangladesh, Ireland and AfghanistanThe first day-night Test was played in November 2015, between Australia and England.",Sports,1
"Get the best of news in your inbox everydayThat Sourav Ganguly has finally succeeded in convincing the Indian team to play a Day/Night Test is a result of his three-year effort. As early as June 2016, as the then CAB president, he had held the final of the Super League – a local tournament – under lights with pink ball as a precursor to a possible pink ball Test against New Zealand who toured India that year for a three-Test series. For various reasons the D/N Test had to be aborted.Not the one to give up, Ganguly, who was also the BCCI’s technical committee chairman, recommended the Duleep Trophy to be played under lights. With the former India captain now at the helm of BCCI affairs as its president and Bangladesh being the visiting country, it wasn’t too hard for him to convince all parties involved to buy into his idea of a Day/Night Test at Eden Gardens. So, from November 22-26, India and Bangladesh – the only two countries apart from new entrants Ireland and Afghanistan yet to play a pink ball Test – will fight it out under lights.While the air is thick with excitement, there is also a sense of apprehension about the unknown. Cricket, as it is, is a game that’s largely dictated by extraneous factors. From the nature of the pitch to the condition of the outfield to the changing weather, all go into influencing a game of cricket. Just as pitch conditions – one of the most alluring parts of Test cricket – have lost their original character over the years at many venues across the world, the changing equipment too has caused the evolution of the game. And the cricket ball is one of the major contributors towards that progress.From red to white to pink, the sphere has been central to cricket’s effort to stay relevant with the changing times and their demands. From ODIs to coloured clothing and day/night affairs to T20 cricket, the game - despite obvious resistance to changes - has successfully reinvented itself but has largely restricted these innovations to limited-over format, leaving the traditional longer version untouched.The dwindling footfalls at stadia and depleting TV viewership, however, forced the stakeholders to hit upon the idea of Day/Night Test to draw the working class to watch the action in the evening. The proposal was great but there were a number of factors that had to be taken care of and not least the type of ball to be used. It couldn’t have been the conventional red nor the white used for limited-over contests.Kookaburra, the pioneers in cricket ball manufacturing, tried yellow and orange before settling for pink for its better visibility. While the same technique and process is followed in producing all cricket balls – a cork core that is layered with woolen yarn and covered by a leather case with either hand-sewn or partially hand-sewn seam which changes depending on manufacturers – it’s the colour of the ball that dictates the behaviour of the ball. Here is an attempt to decode behaviour of three different balls.So why the colour pink and why not yellow or orange that can also be spotted under lights?The manufacturers settled for pink after the batsmen complained that optic yellow and bright orange -- which could be spotted on the grass and while taking high catches -- merged with brownish patches on the pitch.Is there any difference in the process different balls are made?The specifications for producing a red or a white or a pink ball are the same but the difference lies in behaviour which is the result of difference in finishing. Pink balls deteriorate more slowly than white balls, but have better night visibility than red balls, making them the most suitable ball for day-night Test cricket. While the red Test ball is applied with grease to make the leather waterproof, the same can’t be done to the pink ball as the grease would make the fluorescent pink duller which means the visibility of the ball under lights is affected. The subtle changes relate to the protective film that is added to preserve the pink colour so that it sparkles all night. The downside of it is that the extra coat slows down the wear and tear of the ball, which results in prolonged boring periods.What’s the difference between white and pink balls which are used in the night?While the durability and visibility of a pink ball is superior to that of a while ball, they both have certain similar traits. Both swing more initially but go flat sooner than a red ball. The seam movement of pink is more pronounced but once the ball gets softer, the swing too disappears. With the extra coat of colour preventing the fading of the leather, the reverse swing is taken out of equation as well while spinners find it hard to turn.How do conditions affect the outcome of D/N Tests?It’s interesting to note that despite prolonged periods of struggles for bowlers with the pink ball, all nine D/N Tests played so far have produced outright results. While the sample is small, you can see a clear pattern emerging. Where in Australia and New Zealand the bowlers have dominated, matches in England and Asia have seen batsmen score double and triple tons.What’s the best phase for bowlers?The pattern in the D/N Tests again shows that most of these matches turn interesting in the twilight zone when the sun is setting and the artificial lights are slowly coming on. Cheteshwar Pujara recently spoke of the necessity of batsmen to cope with this phase when the natural and artificial lights mix and make the task of spotting the ball difficult. The dipping temperatures during that time of the day aid more swing, resulting in a clutch of wickets.NationalKarnatakaBengaluruSportsBusinessMultimediaOpinionEntertainmentMaharashtra Government Formation 2019 LiveKarnataka Bypolls 2019 LiveIndia vs BangladeshChandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visualsAyodhya verdictPegasus snoops through WhatsAppDH PicksLatest storiesTrending newsServicesOur group sitesWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

"Day/night cricket, also known as floodlit cricket, is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under floodlights in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) , attracting large crowds to see some of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.Floodlit first-class cricket was first played in 1994, when the concept was tried during the Sheffield Shield.[1] Day/night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]In October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.[2] The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015, 36 years to the day from the first ICC sanctioned day night match.[3]It is believed that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to ""Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise."" The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: ""What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?""[4]It appeared that the cricketing world concurred with The Times that playing cricket under floodlights was not a viable concept, and for over twenty years Jack Young's benefit remained a one-off. However, in 1977, when Kerry Packer bought over 50 of the world's leading cricketers to play in his World Series Cricket, the concept came to the fore.[5] After initial attendances at the matches were low, Packer moved from so called ""Supertests"" to one-day cricket, generally played under floodlights. Attendances of roughly 2,000 had attended the ""Supertests"" between Australia and the West Indies at the Australian rules football stadium, VFL Park in Melbourne in November 1977. A year later – almost to the day, 44,377 people were inside the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a floodlit one-day match between the same sides. Opposition to World Series Cricket was large, and the matches did not have Test cricket nor first-class cricket status. In 1979 an agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer brought World Series Cricket to an end.[5] The marketing potential of floodlit cricket had been noticed though, and the first floodlit One Day International was contested in November 1979 between the official cricket teams of Australia and the West Indies.[6]Floodlit cricket was soon taking place not only in Australia, but also in South Africa, the West Indies and the subcontinent. In England, opposition remained firm; not only was there lingering hostility towards Packer's World Series Cricket, but the differences in climate make the application difficult. In contrast to Australia and South Africa, where twilight is minimal, and the light fades quickly, the long English evenings meant that the floodlights would only be required for the last hour or so of a match. The increased chance of rain also meant that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was loath to spend money on permanent lights, when rain would stop play anyway.[7]Day/Night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]During the late 2000s, discussions regarding the possibility of playing day/night Test matches occurred. In the West Indies, the first floodlit first-class cricket match in which the teams used a pink ball, was played between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago[8] The viability of using a pink ball was also tried out by Cricket Australia and some Indian Premier League and Bangladesh Cricket League franchises.[9] The annual curtain-raiser to the English cricket season in 2010 was played under floodlights in Abu Dhabi, with a mixed but generally positive reception.[10] A year later, in 2011, the first County Championship game to be played under lights was played, between Kent and Glamorgan at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.[11]The field Shield [[The oournsj\ hud FFJUSUHS; 
] included three-day/night first-class matches with pink balls.[12] The trials continued in 2014–15 as Cricket Australia looked to host the first day-night Test in 2015 against New Zealand.[13] This match took place at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015.[3]India's first pink ball match took place in Kolkata on 18 July 2016. It was CAB Super League Final between Bhowanipore Club and Mohan Bagan.[citation needed] Mohan Bagan won the match by 296 runs. The 2016 Duleep Trophy matches were played under the lights in Greater Noida. Feedback about the ball was that due to the brightness of the ball, the team handling the camera was able to track the pink ball better than the red. However, catching the ball in the deep during day-light was relatively difficult compared to the red ball.[14] In September 2016, the BCCI confirmed that there would be no day/night Tests in India during the 2016–17 season.[15] Incidentally, the first day-night first-class match in India was held much earlier: in April 1997, the Ranji trophy final between Delhi and Mumbai was played at Gwalior under lights. A pink ball was not used, with play carried for five days using a white ball.The second day/night Test took place between Pakistan and the West Indies on 13–17 October 2016.[16] In October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test between England and the West Indies in August 2017 would be played as a day/night game.[17]Australia played two day/night Tests in their home summer of 2016/17: one against South Africa at Adelaide and one against Pakistan at Brisbane.On 7 March 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed that the first ever day/night women's Test would be played between Australia and England. This was the sole Test of the 2017–18 Women's Ashes series and was played at the North Sydney Oval.[18]",Sports,1

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia are gearing up to play their 1st ever pink-ball Test at Eden Gardens Kolkata from November 22. Bangladesh will be their opposition in the much-anticipated clash that comes after India thrashed the tourists by an innings and 130 in the 1st of the ongoing 2-match Test series.The 1st ever day-night Test was played between Australia and New Zealand in 2015 and 11 pink-ball Tests have been played since but India had stayed away from the experimental format until Sourav Ganguly took over as Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president.India had said no to Australia and West Indies in the past when they came forward to host India in day-night Tests. Also, India also missed out on a chance to host in the 2016-17 season.Over the years, the Indian team management had cited lack of pink-ball exposure for their inhibition to play day-night Tests. However, Sourav Ganguly said Virat Kohli readily agreed to his request to play the upcoming pink-ball Test against Bangladesh.In India, there are only a handful of pink-ball matches that have been played so far. Duleep Trophy, India's 4-day cricket tournament, was played with the pink ball for three seasons. The 1st ever pink-ball cricket match played in India was the Cricket Association of Bengal Super League Final played at the Eden Gardens in 2016.Here's a look at how India cricketers have fared in pink-ball cricketFirstly, captain Virat Kohli has no competitive pink-ball experience. Vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and pacer Umesh Yadav also have no pink-ball exposure. Shubman Gill completes the group of 5 players which has zero competitive pink-ball experience in the India squad.Rohit SharmaRohit Sharma played the final of Duleep Trophy 2016 -- the first edition of the tournament that was played with the pink ball. Rohit scored 30 and 32 for India Blue in their massive 355-run win over India Red at Greater Noida.Mayank AgarwalIn-form opener Mayank Agarwal was the star of India's 1st experiment with the pink ball. Mayank scored 161 for India Blue and shone in the final as well with 2 half-centuries.Mayank amassed a total of 419 runs from 5 innings with scores of 92, 161, 58, 57, 52 -- not a single score less than fifty in pink-ball cricket. He is certainly the one to watch out for in India's inaugural pink-ball Test.Cheteshwar PujaraPujara, as expected, found success in the pink-ball format as well. Pujara scored 2 daddy hundreds. His score of 256 helped India Blue win the Duleep Trophy in 2016. It is also the highest score in pink-ball cricket by an India batsman.Pujara ended the 2016 Duleep Trophy season with scores of 166, 31, 256.Virat KohliHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Ajinkya RahaneHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Wriddhiman SahaEven though Wriddhiman Saha was not part of pink-ball Duleep Trophy matches, the wicketkeeper-batsman took part in the historic CAB Super League final.Playing for Mohun Bagan Bhowanipore, Saha scored 33 in the 1st innings but was dismissed for 0 in the second.Ravindra JadejaRavindra Jadeja was also part of the 2016 Duleep Trophy season. He shone with two 5-wicket hauls with the pink ball in the final for India Blue. Jadeja also chipped in with the bat scoring 48 and 17 in the season. It was a dream outing for the India spinner who finished the match with figures of 171/10.R AshwinHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Umesh YadavHasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.Mohammed ShamiLike his Bengal teammate Wriddhiman Saha, Mohammed Shami was also part of the historic CAB Super League final. Shami was at the top of his game in the pink-ball match and was nearly unplayable under lights. He took a 5-wicket haul and was declared the Man of the Match of the CAB Super League final.Shami shone with figures of 5/42, 2/82 for Mohun Bagan and hit 27 from 16 balls as well.Ishant SharmaPacer Ishant Sharma played 1 match in Duleep Trophy 2017 and managed to pick up a wicket. He also chipped in with the bat, scoring 9 runs for India Blue in Kanpur.Apart from them, Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant and Hanuma Vihari also have competitive pink-ball experience.Kuldeep shone in the 2016 Duleep Trophy, picking up 11 wickets while Hanuma Vihari scored 105 in the only Duleep Trophy pink-ball match he featured in 2017.Rishabh Pant, who is in the India squad, managed scores of 11, 15 and 46 in Duleep Trophy 2017.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe BCCI President Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday said that the tickets for the first four days of India's first Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata have been sold out and he was extremely happy about it.India play their first Day/Night Test against Bangladesh in Kolkata from November 22 and both the teams have reached the eastern megapolis.""It's sold out and I'm extremely happy (about it),"" said Ganguly here after visiting the BCCI headquarters.Asked for how many days it was sold out, Ganguly informed four.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia is barely days away from its first ever pink ball Test match. On November 22, Virat Kohli's India will take on Bangladesh in a historic Day-night Test with many dignitaries from several fields set to be in attendance.In 2018, BCCI had turned down an offer to play a Day-night Test in Australia. For the record, 11 Day-night Tests have been played so far and Australia are the most dominant team with 5 wins in 5 matches.So what is so different about the Day-night Tests? For starters, obviously a certain part of the day's proceedings will be played under lights. Unlike the traditional start time of 9.30 AM for Test matches in India, play will start at 1 PM.Moreover, pink balls will be used in place of red balls for better visibility under lights.As the historic Test match approaches, both the Indian and Bangladeshi teams are training in Indore to get used to the pink ball. India had wrapped up victory in the first Test inside 3 days and they have used the extra time to get some sessions with the pink ball.This historic occasion at the Eden Gardens will be graced by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the sporting greats of India.8 of the 12 Test-playing nations have had a stint with the pink ball. India are the only major Test-playing nation to have not played a day-night Test while Bangladesh, too, will also be making their debut with the pink ball.As Kolkata gears up for India's 1st Test under lights, here we bring to you everything that you need to know about the Pink ball Test cricket:What is the concept behind pink ball cricket?With the shorter format of the game coming into picture, Test cricket has been struggling to get its share of viewership. So, the whole idea behind this day-night match is to get the spectator interested in Tests once again.Soon after his appointed as BCCI president, former captain Sourav Ganguly, who has always been an ardent supporter of Day/Night Test, was successful in convincing both the teams to make their debut with the pink ball.""That's the way forward. Test cricket needed a rejuvenation,"" Ganguly had said.""It happens all around the world. Somewhere it had to start. India is the biggest country in terms of cricket. I think that rejuvenation was important.""India's last series against South Africa witnessed a poor turnout but the ticket demands for the pink ball Test have been quite high.Thirty per cent of the online saleable tickets for the first three days (5,905 tickets) has been sold out, while over 3,500 tickets for the fourth day of the second Test have been sold, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) secretary Avishek Dalmiya had informed.India's earlier reluctance to play with the pink ballIndia have shown years of resistance against playing a day-night Test. Last year, India had refused to play the Adelaide Test under lights. Cricket Australia were insistent on having a pink ball Test, which has been a convention for all touring teams for the past few years but the BCCI were reluctant to play only the traditonal red-ball matches.India team coach Ravi Shastri had then informed Cricket Australia that the team will take at least 18 months to prepare for a pink ball Test.Though India have never played with pink ball in international stage, players like Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay have played Day-Night pink ball matches in Duleep Trophy.When was the first Day-night Test Played?The first Day/Night Test was played in 2015 between Australia and New Zealand at Adelaide. Australia won that match by 3 wickets with Josh Hazlewood picking up 6 wickets.11 Day/Night matches have been played in total, and all of them had a winner. Australia is the most successful side so far in pink-ball cricket, winning all their five games that were all played at home.Sri Lanka is the second in the list with two wins out of three. England, South Africa and New Zealand have won one Test each.Interesting figures in the Pink ball Tests played so farDuring England's tour of New Zealand, Trent Boult and Tim Southee blew away the vistors for 58- their 6th lowest Test total. England managed 320 in their second innings as New Zealand won that match by an innings and 49 runs.While bowling was on display in New Zealand, the batting milestone came in Dubai during the match between Pakistan and West Indies where Azhar Ali scored a triple century becoming the fourth Pakistan player to do so.Talking about spinners Devendra Bishoo’s 8/49 in Dubai are the best figures with pink ball.Match and session timings for historic Test at Eden GardensCAB secretary Avishek Dalmiya informed that the play will start each day at 1 pm IST, and by the time it resumes at 3.40 pm IST after a 40 minute Lunch break, the floodlights would be on. After tea break at 5.40 pm IST, the final session will be held between 6 to 8 pm IST.Who said what about the pink ballIndia skipper Virat Kohli has said that the team is ""very excited"" about playing a pink-ball Test against Bangladesh.""It's quite exciting,"" Kohli said. ""I think it's a new way to bring excitement to Test cricket. We are all very excited about that. The pink ball I played yesterday, I felt it swings a lot more as compared to the red ball because there's extra lacquer on the ball which doesn't go away too fast. And the seam holds upright quite a bit.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowIndia are set to play their maiden pink ball Test when they take on Bangladesh in the 2nd and final match of the ongoing series at Eden Gardens, starting from November 22 in Kolkata. Since the first ever day-night Test played between Australia and New Zealand in 2015, the Eden Gardens game will be the 12th pink ball encounter in the history of Test cricket.The first Day-night Test match was played in a bid to make the 5-day format more attractive for spectators and enable them to attend matches even after work. India had resisted playing Day-Night Test matches earlier because of reservations about playing conditions and suitability of playing under floodlights over a five-day period but the appointment of Sourav Ganguly as the BCCI president paved the way for country's 1st Test match under lights.Till date, Australia are the most successful side in pink-ball cricket, having won each of their 5 games under lights whereas West Indies have the worst record - they have lost all their 3 pink ball Tests so far.Time to gear up for the Pink! #TeamIndia begin prep under lights in Indore for the Kolkata Test #INDvBAN pic.twitter.com/MVzkaVjdmLAustralia featured in the first ever Day-Night Test, played at Adelaide against New Zealand from November 27-December 1, 2015, and won the contest by three wickets. Australia registered two more Test wins in Adelaide -- against South Africa by seven wickets in November 2016, and versus England by 120 runs in December 2017.Australia's two other victories in Day-night Tests have come in Brisbane -- against Pakistan by 39 runs in December 2016, and vs Sri Lanka by an innings and 40 runs 3 years later. Sri Lanka are second in the list of most successful teams in Day-Night Tests, with two wins in three games.Pakistan dominate the batting records in Day-night Tests. Pakistan's Azhar Ali has outscored every other batsman against the pink ball, having amassed 456 runs at an astonishing average of 91 in 6 innings. Steve Smith of Australia is the only other batsman with 400-plus runs in Day-Night Tests. He has 405 runs from 4 Tests, with one hundred and three fifties at an average of 50.62. Ali, being the only triple centurion in pink ball cricket, also holds the record of the highest individual score under lights. Also, Pakistan's Asad Shafiq is the only batsman to hit two centuries in Day/Night Tests.Australia's left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc is the most successful bowler in Day-night Tests. Across five Tests, he has claimed 26 wickets at an average of 23, with one five-wicket haul. As Australia have dominated Day-night Tests so far, it is no surprise that another Australian pacer, Josh Hazlewood, is second on the list having claimed 21 wickets in four Tests at an average of 22.42. West Indies leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo has to his name the record for the best individual bowling figures in an innings in Day-night Tests. He claimed 8 for 49 from 13.5 overs in Pakistan's second innings, during the Dubai Test in October 2016. Pat Cummins's 6 for 23 against Sri Lanka at Brisbane in January 2019 is the next best.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Media AdvisoryOctober 29, 2019The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Tuesday announced that the second Test match of the upcoming Bangladesh tour of India, 2019, scheduled to be played in Kolkata from November 22nd will be India’s first Day-Night Test match.Mr Sourav Ganguly, President, BCCI, said: “I’m pleased to announce that our long-term partner BCB has graciously agreed to play a Day-Night Test match. This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket. It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet.“In this effort of ours, Day-Night Test cricket is a huge step forward and we believe it will bring back the crowd into stadiums and a whole lot of young children to the sport. I am extremely honoured that the Eden Gardens will host the inaugural Day-Night Test match and the Cricket Association of Bengal will create a spectacle for everyone to watch. I thank the Bangladesh Cricket Board President Mr. Nazmul Hassan and his team for accepting our request on such a short notice. I also thank India Captain Mr. Virat Kohli for his co-operation.”Mr. Jay Shah, Secretary, BCCI, said: “It is a great day for Indian cricket. India will host Bangladesh in our first ever Day-Night Test match at Eden Gardens. Sourav, myself and our team had an idea of revolutionizing Test cricket and this is our first step towards it.

"Day/night cricket, also known as floodlit cricket, is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under floodlights in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) , attracting large crowds to see some of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.Floodlit first-class cricket was first played in 1994, when the concept was tried during the Sheffield Shield.[1] Day/night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]In October 2012, the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches.[2] The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015, 36 years to the day from the first ICC sanctioned day night match.[3]It is believed that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and was not the first benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal Stadium had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on towards the end of the first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to ""Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise."" The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: ""What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?""[4]It appeared that the cricketing world concurred with The Times that playing cricket under floodlights was not a viable concept, and for over twenty years Jack Young's benefit remained a one-off. However, in 1977, when Kerry Packer bought over 50 of the world's leading cricketers to play in his World Series Cricket, the concept came to the fore.[5] After initial attendances at the matches were low, Packer moved from so called ""Supertests"" to one-day cricket, generally played under floodlights. Attendances of roughly 2,000 had attended the ""Supertests"" between Australia and the West Indies at the Australian rules football stadium, VFL Park in Melbourne in November 1977. A year later – almost to the day, 44,377 people were inside the Sydney Cricket Ground to watch a floodlit one-day match between the same sides. Opposition to World Series Cricket was large, and the matches did not have Test cricket nor first-class cricket status. In 1979 an agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer brought World Series Cricket to an end.[5] The marketing potential of floodlit cricket had been noticed though, and the first floodlit One Day International was contested in November 1979 between the official cricket teams of Australia and the West Indies.[6]Floodlit cricket was soon taking place not only in Australia, but also in South Africa, the West Indies and the subcontinent. In England, opposition remained firm; not only was there lingering hostility towards Packer's World Series Cricket, but the differences in climate make the application difficult. In contrast to Australia and South Africa, where twilight is minimal, and the light fades quickly, the long English evenings meant that the floodlights would only be required for the last hour or so of a match. The increased chance of rain also meant that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was loath to spend money on permanent lights, when rain would stop play anyway.[7]Day/Night cricket is now commonplace in one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket. For instance, all 27 matches in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 were day/night matches,[citation needed] as were most matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.[citation needed]During the late 2000s, discussions regarding the possibility of playing day/night Test matches occurred. In the West Indies, the first floodlit first-class cricket match in which the teams used a pink ball, was played between Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago[8] The viability of using a pink ball was also tried out by Cricket Australia and some Indian Premier League and Bangladesh Cricket League franchises.[9] The annual curtain-raiser to the English cricket season in 2010 was played under floodlights in Abu Dhabi, with a mixed but generally positive reception.[10] A year later, in 2011, the first County Championship game to be played under lights was played, between Kent and Glamorgan at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury.[11]The field Shield [[The oournsj\ hud FFJUSUHS; 
] included three-day/night first-class matches with pink balls.[12] The trials continued in 2014–15 as Cricket Australia looked to host the first day-night Test in 2015 against New Zealand.[13] This match took place at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide on 27 November 2015.[3]India's first pink ball match took place in Kolkata on 18 July 2016. It was CAB Super League Final between Bhowanipore Club and Mohan Bagan.[citation needed] Mohan Bagan won the match by 296 runs. The 2016 Duleep Trophy matches were played under the lights in Greater Noida. Feedback about the ball was that due to the brightness of the ball, the team handling the camera was able to track the pink ball better than the red. However, catching the ball in the deep during day-light was relatively difficult compared to the red ball.[14] In September 2016, the BCCI confirmed that there would be no day/night Tests in India during the 2016–17 season.[15] Incidentally, the first day-night first-class match in India was held much earlier: in April 1997, the Ranji trophy final between Delhi and Mumbai was played at Gwalior under lights. A pink ball was not used, with play carried for five days using a white ball.The second day/night Test took place between Pakistan and the West Indies on 13–17 October 2016.[16] In October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test between England and the West Indies in August 2017 would be played as a day/night game.[17]Australia played two day/night Tests in their home summer of 2016/17: one against South Africa at Adelaide and one against Pakistan at Brisbane.On 7 March 2017, Cricket Australia confirmed that the first ever day/night women's Test would be played between Australia and England. This was the sole Test of the 2017–18 Women's Ashes series and was played at the North Sydney Oval.[18]",Sports,1

"CricketEden Gardens will host the second Test between India and Bangladesh from November 22.    -  Getty ImagesThe Indian cricket team will play its first-ever Day-Night Test match here against Bangladesh, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly said on Tuesday, ending days of speculation surrounding the game.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.The development ended days of speculation after Ganguly first proposed the idea to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, which faced resistance from its players and sat for multiple meetings to convince them.“It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. I and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly said.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Just like Cricket Australia’s annual ‘Pink Test’ (players wear Pink caps) in association with the Jane McGrath Foundation to raise awareness about breast cancer, Ganguly wants the Eden Gardens’ Day-night Test to be an ""annual affair"".Indian cricketers have for long objected to playing with the pink ball, asserting that sighting the ball becomes a problem after it gets old.PioneerIt was Ganguly, who was instrumental in organising the first ever pink ball match in India although it was a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Super League final between Mohun Bagan and Bhowanipore under lights in June, 2016. Ganguly headed the CAB at the time.Two players, who played that match -- Wriddhiman Saha and Mohammed Shami -- are expected to play the first ever pink Test.The BCCI had introduced the pink ball in Duleep Trophy that same year and it continued for three seasons before the Board scrapped it this year due to lack of broadcast coverage.Mayank Agarwal, Ravichandran Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav, Ishant Sharma have also played pink ball Duleep games among the current India players.The spinners have expressed concerns about the dew factor, which they believe, puts them out of equation.Ganguly, however, assured that conditions won’t be a problem.“We will sort this out and there would be no dew. We have day-night one-dayers after all and dew spray is used,” he said.""This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket. It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet,"" he added.Bond of strengthNazmul Hassan, President, BCB, said: “The BCB and BCCI share a very long history of support, co-operation and friendship.

While this form of cricket can attract a lot of crowds to follow test cricket, it becomes difficult for crowds in Indian stadiums due to the strict rules employed in these stadiums, be it carrying food, water, etc. This isn't the case abroad. But given the fan following of cricket in India, this won't be much of a deterrent as much as the first 2 reasons.It shouldn't be too long before India play their first Day/Night test. In fact, reports say that India and Australia might play a Day/Night Test match next year. Let's hope this happens… :)Our priorities have been different.

Proteas didn’t convinced with the pink ball but they had to play. BCCI and players are not happy about the idea as pink ball won’t shine like white ball so it is hard to see the ball in the evening. As 3–4 day-night Test matches, finally too BCCI liked the idea as it improves the collection. Not many spectators in the day test if it is scheduled on weekdays. Day-night test matches starts in the evening will be crowd puller is BCCI impressionBcci is always late in implementing new technology in indian criket. Same happened with DRS. It came very last in india among big test playing country.Some way i feel bcci is correct!!Because they will see the pink ball pros and cons. How?

"Follow UsThe first Day-Night Test match was played in 2016 in a bid to make the five-day format of Test matches more attractive for spectators and to enable them to attend the matches after work.India had resisted playing Day-Night Test matches earlier because of reservations about playing conditions and suitability of playing in floodlights over a five-day period.Last year BCCI had informed Cricket Australia that India would take at least 18 more months to prepare for a Day-Night Test match. However, the new BCCI President and former Cricket captain Sourav Ganguly, within a week of taking over in October, persuaded Virat Kohli to agree to the format, which, Ganguly believes, is the way forward.While Ganguly’s faith has been vindicated by the sale of tickets for the Test match beginning Friday, with tickets for the first three days having sold out, there are still a lot of apprehension among players about playing with the pink ball.While Test matches generally are played with red balls, the One Day Internationals (ODIs) and T20 matches are played with white balls, pink balls are said to ensure better visibility under floodlights.· The Kolkata Test beginning November 22 will be the first-ever Day-Night Test in India. It will be India's 540th Test· The Test will be played with an SG pink ball instead of the usual white Kookaburra ball· The SG manufacturing plant in Meerut was tasked with preparing and delivery of the pink ball for the Eden Gardens Test.· All Test cricket played in India since 1994 has been played with an SG (Sanspareils Greenlands) ball.· Cricket balls are made with four layers of cowhide.· Red balls have a white seam but pink balls have black seams to make it easier for batsmen to spot. Moreover, unlike red balls, grease is not applied on pink balls lest it makes the colour dull and more difficult to see· The match with start at 1 pm and end by 8 pm, keeping the dew factor in mind at Kolkata, as the ball could get wet after 8 pm.· The Eden Gardens game will be the 12th Day-Night encounter in the history of Test cricket.· Australia are the most successful side in the history of Day-Night Tests till date. Australia have a 100 per cent record, winning five out of the five Day-Night Tests played under floodlights.· Sri Lanka are second on the list of the most successful teams in Day-Night Tests, with two wins in three games.· West Indies have the worst record of all, having lost three out of three.· Under dew, India blue coach Aashish Kapoor had compared holding the wet pink ball to holding a bar of soap in your hand.· Indian players said that the pink ball did a little too much when it was new, but then later on it was very difficult to get it to reverse swing.· Players also said the ball behaved differently under lights.Meanwhile, Team India extended their stay at Indore by two days to train under floodlights from Sunday, aiming to get used to the ""twilight"" ahead of the country's first pink-ball Test. The Bangladesh team also decided to stay back and utilise the time, which they have got because of an early finish to the opening Test.Team India has had three pink-ball sessions under lights arranged by National Cricket Academy head and former India captain Rahul Dravid at Bengaluru.""We will specifically train during the twilight because we still don't know what the ball will do during that particular phase,"" a source close to the team management told PTI on conditions of anonymity.Many players who have played the Duleep Trophy, including Cheteshwar Pujara, has said that sighting the pink ball at twilight is a challenge as the crimson colour of the sky and the pink colour of the ball makes it look more like orange.""Obviously, it's a challenge to play with the pink ball. The ball has a lot more lacquer. I haven't bowled a single ball with the pink ball. I just saw it. Sometimes I don't understand if it’s orange or pink, still coming to terms with that,"" said Ravichandran Ashwin.There will be match simulation and players are likely to have nets at Indore with black sight screens. The teams will leave for Kolkata on November 19 and train at the Eden Gardens for the next two days.(With inputs from PTI)For all the latest India News, Follow India Section.",Sports,1
"The first-ever Day-night Test of India vs Bangladesh are all set to be hosted at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. However, dew can pose a hurdle in the Test so the BCCI has agreed to Cricket Association of Bengal’s (CAB) proposal of new timing for the game. The game will start at 1 PM IST and end the day’s play by 8 PM.The first Test under lights was played way back in 2015, both India and Bangladesh will play their first. However, the organisers are taking all possible measures to host the game successfully. They have even made sure that dew does not play a spoil-sport, a BCCI official confirmed that the sessions have also been re-planned as well. The ball is expected to get wet if the play of India vs Bangladesh Test continues to post 8 PM in Kolkata in late November.”Keeping in mind the dew factor, the BCCI approved CAB’s request to change the playing hours in the second Test. While play will start at 1 p.m., the first session will end at 3 p.m. The second session will start from 3:40 p.m. and continue till 5:40 p.m. The final session will be played from 6 p.m. till 8 PM,” the BCCI official was quoted as saying by The Quint.Eden curator Sujan Mukherjee earlier had said that starting early would help to fight the dew factor. He had also said that the ground staff have made all the arrangements to tackle the problem.”The dew factor comes into play mostly after 8-8:30 p.m. as we have seen in white-ball game this time of the year at Eden. Therefore, I don’t think dew will be a problem,” Sujan had said before adding: ”We also have arrangements to tackle dew issues like treatment sprays and all that.””My preparation is the same like I do for any day game. I will make the pitch as sporting as possible. We have had good pitches at Eden in the past and it would be no different. It doesn’t change since it’s a Day-Night affair,” he further added.Meanwhile, the tickets for the historic game is pretty much in demand as the fans are ready to witness the historic moment. The CAB recently took to Twitter and announced that over 50,000 spectators will watch the first three days of the game. The two-match Test series is going to start on Thursday (November 14) where India vs Bangladesh 1st Test will be played in Indore.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});",Sports,1
"{{suggest.tag}}Search for “”Bangladesh Cricket Board has accepted BCCI's request of playing the Kolkata Test of the forthcoming series as a Day-Night game. Eden Gardens will thus become the first Indian venue to host a pink-ball Test.BCCI, under new president Sourav Ganguly, made a proposal for the second Test of the upcoming two-Test series to be a pink-ball and stated that India captain Virat Kohli, too, was in agreement. The BCB had reserved their decision on the invitation, waiting to get a confirmation from the players and the team management.""This is the beginning of something special in Indian cricket,"" Ganguly said. ""It is a priority for the newly elected Office Bearers and members of Apex Council to take Indian cricket forward. For me, as former Captain of India and as the current President of BCCI, Test cricket is of utmost priority and we at BCCI will leave no stone unturned to bring this format back to its feet.""In this effort of ours, Day-Night Test cricket is a huge step forward and we believe it will bring back the crowd into stadiums and a whole lot of young children to the sport. I am extremely honoured that the Eden Gardens will host the inaugural Day-Night Test match and the Cricket Association of Bengal will create a spectacle for everyone to watch. I thank the Bangladesh Cricket Board President Mr. Nazmul Hassan and his team for accepting our request on such a short notice. I also thank India Captain Mr. Virat Kohli for his co-operation,"" he added.Bangladesh, like India, haven't played a pink-ball Test match since the concept saw the light of the day in November 2015. Green-lighting the game, Bangladesh head coach Russell Domingo said his players, all of whom were consulted, were excited at the prospect of playing the top-ranked team in such a novel game at an iconic venue.""As the coach and some of the players and all the other senior players, we think that it's a great opportunity,"" Domingo said on Tuesday (October 29). ""I don't think India have played a pink-ball Test before. We haven't played a pink-ball Test. It's a massive occasion at the Eden Gardens.""It will be a new experience for both the teams. So we are very excited about it. It will be a great occasion under the lights against one of the best team in the world, probably the best team in the world also. So we are really looking forward to the challenge.""India's decision to welcome the idea of a D/N Test under Ganguly is a departure from their previous skepticism of the concept. BCCI had been invited to play a pink-ball Test in Adelaide by Cricket Australia on their 2018-19 tour, but had turned it down citing lack of practice.Incidentally, the pink ball debuted in India at the Eden Gardens in 2016 during the CAB Super League final of 2016. Subsequently, BCCI turned the four-day Duleep Trophy competition into a pink-ball tournament at the start of 2016 with an eye on eventually playing a D/N Test match in India. Concerns about the lack of spin and reverse swing on offer with the pink ball remained as the the tournament continued to be played with the pink SG ball until 2019, when the final originally slated to be played with the pink ball, went ahead with the red ball as a day game.Coincidentally, Bangladesh too have held that skepticism, turning down New Zealand's proposal last year due to lack of match preparation. Incidentally, both India and Bangladesh will have just two days of preparation between the Indore and the Kolkata Tests to acclimatise against the pink ball.""I have spoken to the players. For sure there have been some concerns,"" Domingo said. ""Some guys said it will be just a few days [of] preparations. There is only two days between first and second Test... In my time with South Africa, we played a pink-ball Test in Adelaide with Australia. We had a warm-up game before. We had few sessions. So it will be a less time to start. I have worked with pink-ball and hope it will be an advantage for us.""There is a travel day and two practice days. And that's all at the moment. During that time there will be some pink-ball preparation. But our focus will be first Test first. Once that is completed, we will prepare for the pink balls. There are some challenges but it is same for India. They haven't played a day-night Test match. So it will be same for both the teams. Not a lot preparation time but [it is] an exciting event. Because of the pink-ball, it may help both the teams little bit close together and we are excited about the opportunity,"" he added.Bangladesh begin their India tour with the three T20Is, starting on November 3, before heading to Indore to kick off their World Test Championship campaign from November 14. The timings of the second Test at Eden Gardens, to be played from November 22, will now be tweaked for a slightly late start in-order to play the final session under lights.",Sports,1

Don’t miss a moment and keep up with the latest from around the world of cricket!Former India batsman Sachin Tendulkar has welcomed the arrival of day-night Test cricket in the country, and said that it would be a good move so long as dew does not become an impeding factor.The second Test between India and Bangladesh, at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, is set to be played under lights, but with the match taking place in east India, where the night sets in early during winter season, dew could not only be a bigger factor, but it could also be a factor for a longer duration of the Test.It isn’t clear yet if the BCCI would advance the game’s start time to offset that probability, but Tendulkar said that if dew does start playing a prominent role, both spinners and seamers could be taken out of the equation.🌞🌚🏏India and Bangladesh will each make their day/night Test debuts next month at Kolkata's Eden Gardens! Who's excited to see how it pans out?#INDvBANhttps://t.co/crFOZpPsEu""As long as dew does not become a factor, it is a good move,"" Tendulkar was quoted as saying by PTI. ""But if dew is going to be a factor, then seamers as well as spinners are going to find it challenging, because once the ball gets wet, neither seamers can do much, nor the spinners. So bowlers will be put under the test. But if there is no dew, then surely it is a good addition.""We need to figure out how much dew is there. The dew will determine to what extent both teams are competing. The conditions shouldn't hinder anything.""It is a nice concept, as people would be able to watch a day-night Test after their working hours. People can come in the evening and enjoy the game. From players' point of view, it won't be a bad idea to play with the pink ball and check how differently it behaves from the traditional red ball.""Sachin TendulkarThe pink ball, albeit of the Kookaburra variety, has come with its share of problems in the past, most notably with its ability to retain shine, and the seam, which isn’t as pronounced as the one in the traditional red ball.The Kolkata Test will be played using the pink SG ball, which has never been used before, so not much is known about how it might behave. Nevertheless, Tendulkar’s advice for India’s batsmen was to bat against a new, semi-new, and an old ball to understand how it behaves at various stages.""The batsmen will need to practice with different balls at the nets,"" he said. ""A new pink ball, a 20-over pink ball and a 50-over pink ball and an 80-over ball. See how differently a new, semi-new and old ball behaves. Accordingly, prepare your strategy.""Another concern is how the grass, which there usually is more of in day-night Tests than is the case in a traditional Test match, to help maintain the condition of the pink ball, might affect the spinners. But Tendulkar said a quality spinner might not be too troubled by that.""Obviously, it (the presence of more grass) will help the seamers more, but if you bring in [a] quality spinner, he will find his way to bowl on that surface as well,"" Tendulkar said. ""For a spinner, it will be important to assess how much bounce is there on the surface and how much the ball is skidding; if there is too much grass [or] whether the ball is gripping on the surface.""News, fixtures and updates tailored to your favourite team.

India as a Test playing country, it was necessary for us to play Day-Night Test. The office-going crowd which couldn’t catch Test cricket can now do so,” Ashwin said when asked about his opinion.But there will be challenges that need to be countered, including extra lacquer, which could be detrimental for slow bowlers.Also Read:  Ban ends today; Mumbai, India await Prithvi Shaw 2.0“Obviously, it’s a challenge to play with the pink ball. The ball has a lot more lacquer. Personally I think it’s the right direction we have taken, and hopefully, the Test match will be a historic moment and it will be the start of many more to come.”   Having not played a single game with the pink ball till now, Ashwin is still getting adjusted to the colour, which, at times, looks more orange than pink.“For starters you can’t sleep at 9 o’ clock anymore in the night. Apparently, the game is starting at 1 pm.    “I’ve never played a pink ball game. I didn’t play the Duleep Trophy that happened a few years ago. I haven’t even bowled a single ball with the pink ball. Obviously I just saw it. Sometimes I don’t understand if its orange or pink, still coming to terms with that,” he said.He expects the pink ball to do a lot more in the evening on a re-laid pitch in Kolkata.“I think having played in Kolkata before, it does a lot more in the evening and the pitch is re-laid. It does move a little bit with the white ball so you can imagine what could happen with the pink or orange ball. We are all little wary but excited about the game,” he said.On having permanent Test centres, Ashwin wants an academic discussion on the subject rather than going into whether it would be prudent or not.“Every other Test playing nation generally has a certain pattern of playing Test cricket. They do know how the venue behaves, how the pitch behaves, how the games pans out. That’s perennially how Test cricket works in most parts of the world. Even in India it was no exception.“But of late, with a lot of cricketers coming from different parts of the country, cricket has grown and gone to every nook and corner which is a great sign. Hence we are having Test matches in various venues,” reasoned Ashwin.He would like to leave it to the administrators to decide whether it was the right or wrong decision.“The understanding of a particular venue and keeping it that way will help the players. Whether or not that’s the right thing to do is something decision makers will have to take,” he concluded.",Sports,1
"India will play their first ever Day-Night Test versus Bangladesh at Eden Gardens from 22-26 NovGanguly was talking at the book launch of five-time ICC 'Umpire of the Year' Simon Taufel, titled 'Finding The Gaps'Kolkata: ""Just three seconds"" is all what it took Sourav Ganguly to convince India captain Virat Kohli into playing a Day/Night Test match against Bangladesh, the BCCI president revealed on Saturday.Less than a week after he took reins of BCCI, Ganguly, who had introduced pink ball at domestic level as the technical committee chairman three years ago, was successful in changing the Indian Cricket Board's stance.India thus will finally play their first ever day/night Test versus Bangladesh at Eden Gardens here from November 22-26, about four years after Australia and New Zealand set it going in Adelaide.""Honestly I don't know why and what was the reason they did not want to play and accept the D/N Test (in Adelaide). I met him for an hour and the first question was we need to have day/night Tests and the answer in three seconds was let's go ahead and do that,"" Ganguly said about meeting Kohli ahead of the selection committee meeting in Mumbai on October 24.Ganguly was talking at the book launch of five-time ICC 'Umpire of the Year' Simon Taufel, titled 'Finding The Gaps'.The Indian team had previously put down Australia's request for a pink-ball Test at the Adelaide Oval last year, while suggestion to host West Indies in day/night Tests too had got shelved.""I really don't know what happened in the past and what was the reason but I found him absolutely acceptable to play D/N Tests. He realises and thinks that empty stands in Tests is not the right way forward.""Ganguly firmly believed that this concept will help Test cricket regain its popularity in the sub-continent at a time when lukewarm response during India's 3-0 whitewash of South Africa became a cause for concern.""I know T20 every stand is full in every game. But proper management of Test cricket will bring back crowd. It's a start for India. I think with this concept Test cricket will be back on its feet.""""Now people's lives have changed, you cannot leave offices so that's when you have to make adaptability. That's important. Most number of times change is good. A lot of time, we hold on to things thinking what you believe is right,"" Ganguly said.Urging the need for better marketing, he said: ""It's when you're forced to come out of your comfort zone, you actually find out it's better than what you think. I think pink ball will bring back crowd and the Test cricket needs to be marketed a lot more.""Ganguly further recalled the epic 2001 Eden Test when India bounced back to defeat Australia by 171 runs.""My 100th Test was a Boxing Day Test at MCG. You really got fortunate to get in that position in your Test career. There were close to 70,000 people in the stands in Test match on day one.

"India look set to host their first-ever day-night Test against visiting Bangladesh at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Published: 29th  October 2019 06:17 AM  |

  |  A+A A-Eden GardensCHENNAI: India look set to host their first-ever day-night Test against visiting Bangladesh at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) had already sent a proposal in this regard to Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) a few days ago. The Bangladesh board, in turn, has referred it to the players and team management.Former India captain Sourav Ganguly floated the idea soon after taking over as BCCI president and it was even accorded in-principle agreement by Apex Council members. He also spoke to India captain Virat Kohli regarding the match.The BCB officials are convinced by the proposal but the only hitch might be players’ concern over lack of match practice with pink balls.“BCB president Nazmul Hassan Papon met players and support staff on Monday and asked them to arrive at a decision over the next 24 hours. A final decision will be made on Tuesday afternoon,” BCB sources said. Though Ganguly has requested the BCB to reply by Monday night, his Bangladesh counterparts wanted to know players’ opinion before confirming.The players apparently are divided on this and will convey their decision by Tuesday. The Indian board has already conveyed its intention to groundsmen at Eden Gardens. The Test is scheduled to begin on November 22.New pink ball experienceIndia & Bangladesh along with two new full members — Afghanistan and Ireland — are the only Test-playing nations not to have played a day-night Test yet.O

   -  Vivek BendreThe Indian cricket team will play its first ever Day-Night Test match here against Bangladesh next month, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly told PTI on Tuesday, taking a path-breaking decision within a week into his nine-month tenure.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.The development ended days of speculation after Ganguly first proposed the idea to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, which faced resistance from its players and sat for multiple meetings to convince them.“The BCB has confirmed and we are having a pink-ball Test. It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. Me and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly told PTI.Bangladesh’s South African coach Russell Domingo conceded in Dhaka that there are concerns about how the match will pan out but the team has decided to accept the change and explore new avenues. The match will start at 2pm (IST) and will comprise a Tea and Dinner break.“We think it’s a great opportunity. I don’t think India has played a pink ball Test before. It’s a massive occasion at Eden Gardens against one of the best teams in the world,” Domingo said.“We are looking forward to that challenge. There are some challenges as we will not have a lot of time to prepare but it’s same for India. I don’t think they have had a day-night Test match. So it will be same for both teams,” he added“Since it’s pink ball, both teams will be close to each other. Sometime change is the best,” the former Proteas coach said.It was Ganguly, who was instrumental in organising the first ever pink ball match in India although it was a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Super League final between Mohun Bagan and Bhowanipore under lights in June, 2016. Ganguly headed the CAB at the time.The BCCI had introduced the pink ball in Duleep Trophy that same year and it continued for three seasons before the Board scrapped it this year due to lack of broadcast coverage.The spinners have expressed concerns about the dew factor, which they believe, puts them out of equation.Ganguly, however, assured that conditions won’t be a problem.“We will sort this out and there would be no dew. We have day-night one-dayers after all and dew spray is used,” he said.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Ganguly, a former India captain and an advocate of the innovation to revive interest in Test cricket, wants to make it an annual affair like Australia’s Pink Test in which the national team wears pink caps to raise breast cancer awareness.Also, with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina set to witness the first day’s proceedings, it is expected to be a carnival at the Eden.Ganguly, within a week of taking over as Board chief, has created a lasting legacy.“It’s just my job, that’s what I’m here for... Because I’ve played this game for so long.

"India’s long-wait to play a day-night Test match will soon be over as multiple reports confirmed on Tuesday that Bangladesh have given their agreement for the second game of the upcoming series, scheduled to take place in Kolkata, to be played under floodlights.The Indian cricket team will now play its first ever day-night Test match, newly-appointed Board of Control for Cricket in India President Sourav Ganguly told PTI on Tuesday, ending days of speculation surrounding the game.“It’s a good development. Test cricket needs this push. Me and my team were bent on it and thanks to Virat (Kohli) also, he agreed,” Ganguly told PTI.The Test is scheduled to be held at the Eden Gardens from November 22-26 and will be the second game of a two-match series.Ganguly had said that the Test will be played with the pink-ball under floodlights pending confirmation from his counterparts.Read: Kohli’s five-stadium suggestion for Test cricket in India opens up interesting debateAccording to a report in ESPNCricinfo, the primary concern for Bangladesh was their lack of match practice with the pink balls, which are used for day-night Tests. The report said that only one game has been played in the country with them: the first-class Bangladesh Cricket League final in February 2013. But it is worth nothing that India do not have significant pink-ball experience either: Virat Kohli’s side are the only Test-playing nation, apart from Bangladesh and the two new Full Members – Afghanistan and Ireland – to not have played a day-night Test yet.D/N test confirmed at Eden Gardens. First ever pink ball Test in India.@SGanguly99 was the one who convinced the @BCBtigers about the need for day night Test matches. All on the same page now.“We all are thinking about this and we will do something about it. I am a firm believer in day-night Tests. I don’t know when will that happen. But till the time I am around, I will be pushing for it,” Ganguly had said after taking over as BCCI chief.He had a meeting with Kohli in Mumbai on Thursday where the idea was floated. “I must say that Virat Kohli is agreeable to it. There are reports that he does not want to play day-night Tests, which is not the fact,” he added.The home Tests against Bangladesh are the last ones for this season, and by the time the longest format returns to India, Ganguly’s reign as BCCI chief is likely to have ended. As a technical committee chairman, Ganguly in the past was a part of the decision to have Duleep Trophy under lights with a pink ball. However, the domestic bowlers had complaints about the quality of the SG Test pink balls which were used.There are plans to invite India’s legendary Olympians like Abhinav Bindra, M C Mary Kom and P V Sindhu and felicitate them for their contribution to the country’s Olympic movement during the match.Just like Cricket Australia’s annual Pink Test in association with the Jane McGrath Foundation to raise awareness about breast cancer, Ganguly wants the Eden Gardens’ Day-night Test to be an annual affair, reported PTI.- Total day-night Tests played so far: 11- First d/n Test: at Adelaide 27-29 Nov 2015 (NZ lost by 3 wkts)- Played by Aus (5), Pak/WI/SL/Eng (3), NZ/SA (2), Zim (1)- Played in Aus (5), in UAE (2), in WI/NZ/SA/Eng (1)- Yet to play: India, Bangladesh, Ireland and AfghanistanThe first day-night Test was played in November 2015, between Australia and England.",Sports,1
"Get the best of news in your inbox everydayThat Sourav Ganguly has finally succeeded in convincing the Indian team to play a Day/Night Test is a result of his three-year effort. As early as June 2016, as the then CAB president, he had held the final of the Super League – a local tournament – under lights with pink ball as a precursor to a possible pink ball Test against New Zealand who toured India that year for a three-Test series. For various reasons the D/N Test had to be aborted.Not the one to give up, Ganguly, who was also the BCCI’s technical committee chairman, recommended the Duleep Trophy to be played under lights. With the former India captain now at the helm of BCCI affairs as its president and Bangladesh being the visiting country, it wasn’t too hard for him to convince all parties involved to buy into his idea of a Day/Night Test at Eden Gardens. So, from November 22-26, India and Bangladesh – the only two countries apart from new entrants Ireland and Afghanistan yet to play a pink ball Test – will fight it out under lights.While the air is thick with excitement, there is also a sense of apprehension about the unknown. Cricket, as it is, is a game that’s largely dictated by extraneous factors. From the nature of the pitch to the condition of the outfield to the changing weather, all go into influencing a game of cricket. Just as pitch conditions – one of the most alluring parts of Test cricket – have lost their original character over the years at many venues across the world, the changing equipment too has caused the evolution of the game. And the cricket ball is one of the major contributors towards that progress.From red to white to pink, the sphere has been central to cricket’s effort to stay relevant with the changing times and their demands. From ODIs to coloured clothing and day/night affairs to T20 cricket, the game - despite obvious resistance to changes - has successfully reinvented itself but has largely restricted these innovations to limited-over format, leaving the traditional longer version untouched.The dwindling footfalls at stadia and depleting TV viewership, however, forced the stakeholders to hit upon the idea of Day/Night Test to draw the working class to watch the action in the evening. The proposal was great but there were a number of factors that had to be taken care of and not least the type of ball to be used. It couldn’t have been the conventional red nor the white used for limited-over contests.Kookaburra, the pioneers in cricket ball manufacturing, tried yellow and orange before settling for pink for its better visibility. While the same technique and process is followed in producing all cricket balls – a cork core that is layered with woolen yarn and covered by a leather case with either hand-sewn or partially hand-sewn seam which changes depending on manufacturers – it’s the colour of the ball that dictates the behaviour of the ball. Here is an attempt to decode behaviour of three different balls.So why the colour pink and why not yellow or orange that can also be spotted under lights?The manufacturers settled for pink after the batsmen complained that optic yellow and bright orange -- which could be spotted on the grass and while taking high catches -- merged with brownish patches on the pitch.Is there any difference in the process different balls are made?The specifications for producing a red or a white or a pink ball are the same but the difference lies in behaviour which is the result of difference in finishing. Pink balls deteriorate more slowly than white balls, but have better night visibility than red balls, making them the most suitable ball for day-night Test cricket. While the red Test ball is applied with grease to make the leather waterproof, the same can’t be done to the pink ball as the grease would make the fluorescent pink duller which means the visibility of the ball under lights is affected. The subtle changes relate to the protective film that is added to preserve the pink colour so that it sparkles all night. The downside of it is that the extra coat slows down the wear and tear of the ball, which results in prolonged boring periods.What’s the difference between white and pink balls which are used in the night?While the durability and visibility of a pink ball is superior to that of a while ball, they both have certain similar traits. Both swing more initially but go flat sooner than a red ball. The seam movement of pink is more pronounced but once the ball gets softer, the swing too disappears. With the extra coat of colour preventing the fading of the leather, the reverse swing is taken out of equation as well while spinners find it hard to turn.How do conditions affect the outcome of D/N Tests?It’s interesting to note that despite prolonged periods of struggles for bowlers with the pink ball, all nine D/N Tests played so far have produced outright results. While the sample is small, you can see a clear pattern emerging. Where in Australia and New Zealand the bowlers have dominated, matches in England and Asia have seen batsmen score double and triple tons.What’s the best phase for bowlers?The pattern in the D/N Tests again shows that most of these matches turn interesting in the twilight zone when the sun is setting and the artificial lights are slowly coming on. Cheteshwar Pujara recently spoke of the necessity of batsmen to cope with this phase when the natural and artificial lights mix and make the task of spotting the ball difficult. The dipping temperatures during that time of the day aid more swing, resulting in a clutch of wickets.NationalKarnatakaBengaluruSportsBusinessMultimediaOpinionEntertainmentMaharashtra Government Formation 2019 LiveKarnataka Bypolls 2019 LiveIndia vs BangladeshChandrayaan-2: ISRO releases new visualsAyodhya verdictPegasus snoops through WhatsAppDH PicksLatest storiesTrending newsServicesOur group sitesWe use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"".

Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India.

They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army.

This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Narendra Modi government on Monday moved to dramatically alter the status quo in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government ended days of speculation by making public its decision to effectively revoke the controversial Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.Article 370 accords special status to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag and rights. On Monday morning, home minister Amit Shah rose in Rajya Sabha to announce that the government was moving a Presidential order for Parliament's ratification.The Presidential order used a clause of Article 370 to say that provisions of Article 370 would no longer be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir, a move that essentially revokes the article without actually doing so.In a follow-up, but equally bold move, Amit Shah also said the government was moving a bill to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories -- Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. While the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir would have a legislature, a la Delhi, Ladakh would not.The Narendra Modi government's historic decision on Jammu and Kashmir, which ranks among the most unprecedented political moves in the country, will be debated for days, even weeks to come. Here is everything you need to know about what happened on Monday.What did the government do today?The government today moved a resolution to effectively abolish Article 370, which gives special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government also introduced a Bill to divide the state into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh.So Jammu and Kashmir is no longer a state?Short answer: Not yet. The Rajya Sabha has passed the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill which bifurcates the state into two Union territories. The Lok Sabha (where the BJP has a brute majority) now must pass the Bill, which will then go to the President for his assent. Once the President signs the Bill and the government issues a notification, Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be a state.READ | Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh: This is how the redrawn map will look likeBasically:And, what about Article 370? Has it been scrapped?Technically: No. As of now, the government has used a clause within Article 370 to make the provisions of the article inoperative.Let us explain.READ | How govt used Article 370 to kill Article 370What even is Article 370?Article 370 is an enabling provision. It explains which parts of the Indian Constitution have jurisdiction over Jammu and Kashmir, which adopted a separate state constitution for itself during the 1950s.According to it, the Central government needs the concurrence of J&K state government for applying laws. Now that changes.READ | Article 370 has not been scrapped. What does Modi govt move on Kashmir mean?So what happens to Article 35A?Article 35A, making a distinction between the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir and the outsiders, will also cease to have any effect in Jammu and Kashmir.Why did the government move to revoke the powers of Article 370?Revoking Article 370 of the Constitution has been a key part of the BJP's core agenda and has always struck an emotional chord with its rank and file after its ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee died in a Jammu and Kashmir jail in 1953 to protest the state's special status and demand its complete integration with the Union.Apart from ideology, the Modi government:Has anybody supported the Modi government on its Article 370 move?Yes, apart from NDA allies Shiv Sena, RPI, Akali Dal and others, regional parties like BSP, AAP, BJD, TRS and AIADMK extended full support to the resolution to effectively scrap Article 370 and the Bill to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe biggest decision of the Narendra Modi government came shortly after 50 days of the beginning of its second term. The government on Monday moved Parliament to remove the special status provision to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, revoking 1954 Presidential proclamation through a gazette notification.With that revocation order, Article 35A no longer exists. The article defined the permanent resident of Jammu and Kashmir and also defined the state's relationship with the Centre, and barred non-permanent residents from permanently settling in J&K. It also gives rights of buying immovable property, acquiring land, applying for government jobs, any kind of scholarships and aids, and other public welfare projects to state domicile.Once the President revokes the order, the special status of the status will be withdrawn. This paves way for what the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long believed - Ek Nishan, Ek Vidhan aur Ek Pradhan (One flag, one Constitution and one leader).Here are some of the significant changes in Jammu and Kashmir:1. J&K Constitution scrappedBefore Article 370 - It was the only state with its own Constitution. The article provided J&K provisions of the Constitution which were not applicable to other states of the country including special autonomy, separate state laws, etc.After Article 370 - With the scrapping provisions of Article 370, the separate Constitution ceases to exist.2. Separate flagBefore Article 370 - The J&K state had two different flags - India and the state.After Article 370 - There would be no separate flag for the state.(Sources, however, said that a decision could be taken on it as Karnataka, too, has proposed its own flag)3. Any Indian can now buy properties in J&KBefore Article 370 - Only residents of J&K could buy and sell properties in the state.After Article 370 - Any Indian citizen will be able to buy and sell properties in J&K.4. CRPC in, RPC outBefore Article 370 - Residents of J&K had separate laws related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights.After Article 370 - There will be no separate laws for the citizens of J&K. Crpc will be in, Ranbir Penal Code of the state will be out.5. The state becomes a Union TerritoryBefore Article 370 - Jammu and Kashmir was a state with special status.After Article 370 - J&K downsized to a Union Territory (UT) with legislature while Ladakh becomes the UT without any legislature.Riots in India are decreasing but becoming more intense: NCRB dataWhat's brewing up in Congress with Sonia back as party chief, dissenters growing?6 murders over 14 years: The Kerala housewife who killed her family for moneyIs ED heat on Opposition a witch-hunt?

"Women, Dalits, tribals and minorities of Jammu and Kashmir are now equal citizens of IndiaSince 5 August, when the government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), the floodgates of righteous rage from the usual suspects from India and the rest of the world have opened. Hardly surprising. This was the jackboot, the blood-soaked end of democracy, a rape of the Constitution, the trampling of fundamental rights of Kashmiris, and so on. These hyperventilating flag-bearers of freedom (or whatever) should calm down and consider one historical fact. Which is this. The “temporary and transitional"" provision Article 370 made an exception to the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Indian Constitution. These fundamental rights have now been restored. And this is shockingly easy to explain.A New York Times columnist has wailed that the government has now converted “the people of Kashmir to second-class citizens, if not subjects"". Sorry, but the truth is that some of these people—specifically the male Kashmiri Muslim—enjoyed far greater rights than any other Indian citizen; they have now been brought down to equal status. And many other inhabitants of the erstwhile state had fewer rights than normal Indian citizens; they have been granted equality. One would think that anyone who believed in democracy would see that as a good thing.To explain this, we must come to “majoritarianism"", over which much chest-beating is going on. Some people have seen the government’s action as “unabashed majoritarianism"". Whereas, if there ever was any unabashed and constitutionally sanctioned majoritarianism anywhere in India, it was in J&K through Article 370. The Constitution of this Muslim-majority state did not have the word “minorities"" anywhere in it. Unlike in the Indian Constitution, their rights were not protected. J&K was also the only Indian state with no tribal rights (and the state had no right to education either). And it should be our national shame that we allow these hypocrites to freely talk of majoritarianism while staying silent about the 20th century’s swiftest forced exodus of a minority community—Hindu Pandits from Kashmir in 1990.There is extensive scare-mongering that the removal of Article 35A will lead to land grab by non-Kashmiris, because the law permitted ownership of immovable property in the state only by permanent residents (PRs). But this law also stipulated that J&K women who married non-PRs, lost their PR status and inheritance rights. When we spoke to an old family friend, a Kashmiri lady engineer married to a non-Kashmiri, who played a key role in the Chandrayaan-2 launch, she was tearful; all she could think of was building a little home in her homeland. Article 35A also ensured that the thousands of descendants of Valmikis (Dalits) who were brought in from Punjab as government sweepers in 1957 were never allowed to get any government jobs other than sweepers. And they could not even get a Scheduled Caste certificate from the state government, so were not eligible for any benefits under central schemes. Hindu and Sikh refugees from West Pakistan remained non-PR second-class citizens, while Uighur Muslims from Xinjiang were granted PR status. And we are supposed to believe that Kashmiri Muslims have become second-class citizens, when in reality, actual second-class citizens now have full citizen rights.Majoritarianism? Watch the video of Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal’s Lok Sabha speech on 6 August to know what majoritarian oppression means to a religious and ethnic minority. Fear is being spread about the government plotting demographic change in Kashmir, like China settling Han Chinese in Tibet. But systematic attempts to change demography have been in progress for years in J&K, through settling Muslims in Buddhist-majority Ladakh (Namgyal mentioned this), and recently, Rohingyas in Jammu.The vast majority of Indians have never understood why J&K deserved special status, and certainly Sardar Patel and B.R. Ambedkar were vehemently opposed to Article 370. Patel told his secretary, V. Shankar: “Jawaharlal royega (Jawaharlal will weep over this)"", and Ambedkar refused to attend the session that passed the motion. And the fact that many Opposition parties supported the revocation, that even Congress is divided over it, obviously indicates that politicians know that the people of our democratic republic feel that it’s time for all Indians to be equal citizens.The real test begins now. With J&K a Union territory, the central government must ensure that funds are deployed properly and don’t line the pockets of a few families and their cronies. However, it will take time before industry feels that the valley is a safe bet. Pakistan will try to up its terrorist game. Also, when the US withdraws its troops from Afghanistan, some of the Taliban’s resources will be available to Pakistan to be re-directed towards Kashmir. But, most importantly, the doubting Kashmiri Muslim must realize that Article 370 made him special in a very negative way. It kept him alienated from his nation for seven decades. No Malayali, Gujarati, Assamese, and no Dogra or Ladakhi has lost his identity because he is an Indian. India has opened her arms. It is now up to sceptical Kashmiris to accept the offer.Sandipan Deb is a former editor of ‘Financial Express’, and founder-editor of ‘Open’ and ‘Swarajya’ magazinesLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIndia's BJP-led government is hailing its decision to strip the state of Jammu and Kashmir of autonomy after seven decades, characterising it as the correction of a ""historical blunder"". The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi explains why this has happened and why it's important.Kashmir is a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan say is fully theirs.The area was once a princely state called Jammu and Kashmir, but it joined India in 1947 soon after the sub-continent was divided up at the end of British rule.India and Pakistan subsequently went to war over it and each came to control different parts of the territory with a ceasefire line agreed.There has been violence in the Indian-administered side - the state of Jammu and Kashmir - for 30 years due to a separatist insurgency against Indian rule.In the first few days of August, there were signs of something afoot in Kashmir.Tens of thousands of additional Indian troops were deployed, a major Hindu pilgrimage was cancelled, schools and colleges were shut, tourists were ordered to leave, telephone and internet services were suspended and regional political leaders were placed under house arrest.But most of the speculation was that Article 35A of the Indian constitution, which gave some special privileges to the people of the state, would be scrapped.The government then stunned everyone by saying it was revoking nearly all of Article 370, which 35A is part of and which has been the basis of Kashmir's complex relationship with India for some 70 years.The article allowed the state a certain amount of autonomy - its own constitution, a separate flag and freedom to make laws. Foreign affairs, defence and communications remained the preserve of the central government.As a result, Jammu and Kashmir could make its own rules relating to permanent residency, ownership of property and fundamental rights. It could also bar Indians from outside the state from purchasing property or settling there.The constitutional provision has underpinned India's often fraught relationship with Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority region to join India at partition.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party had long opposed Article 370 and revoking it was in the party's 2019 election manifesto.They argued it needed to be scrapped to integrate Kashmir and put it on the same footing as the rest of India. After returning to power with a massive mandate in the April-May general elections, the government lost no time in acting on its pledge.Critics of Monday's move are linking it to the economic slowdown that India is currently facing - they say it provides a much-needed diversion for the government.Many Kashmiris believe that the BJP ultimately wants to change the demographic character of the Muslim-majority region by allowing non-Kashmiris to buy land there.Although Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement in parliament on Monday came as a surprise to most Indians, it would have taken the government some preparation to arrive at the decision.The move also fits in with Mr Modi's desire to show that the BJP is tough on Kashmir, and Pakistan.Kashmir will no longer have a separate constitution but will have to abide by the Indian constitution much like any other state.All Indian laws will be automatically applicable to Kashmiris, and people from outside the state will be able to buy property there.The government says this will bring development to the region.""I want to tell the people of Jammu and Kashmir what damage Articles 370 and 35A did to the state,"" Mr Shah told parliament. ""It's because of these sections that democracy was never fully implemented, corruption increased in the state, that no development could take place.""The government is also moving to break up the state into two smaller, federally administered territories. One region will combine Muslim-majority Kashmir and Hindu-majority Jammu. The other is Buddhist-majority Ladakh, which is culturally and historically close to Tibet.P Chidambaram, a senior leader in the opposition Congress Party described the decision as a ""catastrophic step"" and warned in parliament that it could have serious consequences.""You may think you have scored a victory, but you are wrong and history will prove you to be wrong. Future generations will realise what a grave mistake this house is making today,"" he said.According to the constitution, Article 370 could only be modified with the agreement of the ""state government"". But there hasn't been much of a state government in Jammu and Kashmir for over a year now.In June last year, India imposed federal rule after the government of the then chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, was reduced to a minority. This meant the federal government only had to seek the consent of the governor who imposes its rule.The government says it is well within its rights to bring in the changes and that similar decisions have been taken by federal governments in the past.But expert opinion is sharply divided.One constitutional expert, Subhash Kashyap, told news agency ANI that the order was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".However another constitutional expert, AG Noorani, told BBC Hindi it was ""an illegal decision, akin to committing fraud"" that could be challenged in the Supreme Court.Opposition political parties could launch a legal challenge but Kashmir is an emotive issue with many Indians, and most parties would be wary of opposing the move lest they be branded anti-India.That could leave any challenge up to individuals or activists.Lt Col Alexander Vindman listened to the phone call that sparked the impeachment inquiry against the US president.Have you been getting these songs wrong?What happens to your body in extreme heat?",political,0

							  Last Updated at August 5, 2019 07:31 ISThttps://mybs.in/2X7hPhkRumours are afloat that the Modi-led government is set to scrap Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution. The rumours were triggered by reports of Centre deploying additional paramilitary troops to address the likely fallout from the removal of the controversial Article 35A in J&K. The government has, however, said that these are precautionary measures in view of terrorist threats. Meanwhile, various political leaders including former Chief Ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti have been placed under house arrest. Mobile internet services have also been barred.

		The rumours reflect apprehensions in the Valley following Home Minister Amit Shah’s pointed statement in Parliament that Article 370, which deals with the special status of J&K, was “temporary in nature” and “not permanent”. While Jammu wants the provision to be scrapped from the Constitution, Kashmir valley-centric parties, across the board, warn that tampering with the special provision would stir the hornets' nest and the fallout would be difficult to handle.document.write(""<!--"");if(isUserBanner==""free""&&(displayConBanner==1))document.write(""-->"");googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/6516239/outofpage_1x1_desktop','div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0').addService(googletag.pubads());googletag.pubads().enableSyncRendering();googletag.enableServices();});

What are Article 370 and 35A? Are they amendable? If abrogated can it solve the long standing political dispute in Jammu and Kashmir?

Here's an explainer on Article 35A and 370

Article 370 grants an autonomous status to J&K, while Article 35A, incorporated into the Constitution in 1954, provides special rights and privileges to the citizens of the state.

What the two articles mean:

Article 370

History

		In October 1947, the then-Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir signed the ‘Instrument of Accession’, which specified three subjects on which Jammu and Kashmir would transfer its powers to the government of India: 1. Foreign affairs, 2. Defence and 3. Communications. In March 1948, the Maharaja appointed an interim government in the state, with Sheikh Abdullah as the prime minister. In July 1949, Sheikh Abdullah and three other colleagues joined the Indian Constituent Assembly and negotiated the special status of J&K, leading to the adoption of Article 370. The controversial provision was drafted by Sheikh Abdullah.

What are the provisions of Article 370?

		Parliament needs the Jammu & Kashmir government's nod for applying laws in the state — except defence, foreign affairs, finance, and communications.

		The law of citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights of the residents of Jammu & Kashmir is different from the residents living in rest of India. Under Article 370, citizens from other states cannot buy property in Jammu & Kashmir. Under Article 370, the Centre has no power to declare financial emergency.

		It is important to note Article 370(1)(c) explicitly mentions that Article 1 of the Indian Constitution applies to Kashmir through Article 370. Article 1 lists the states of the Union. This means that it is Article 370 that binds the state of J&K to the Indian Union. Removing Article 370, which can be done by a Presidential Order, would therefore make the state independent of India.

Temporary provision or not?

		A petition filed by Kumari Vijayalakshmi Jha challenged the validity of Article 370 against the Delhi High Court's April 11, 2017 order. The petition had said that the continuance of the temporary provision of Article 370 even after dissolution of Constituent Assembly of J&K, and that of J&K Constitution, which has never got the assent of the President of India or Parliament or the government of India, ""amounts to fraud on the basic structure of our Constitution"".

Article 35A

What is it?

		Article 35A gives the Jammu & Kashmir Legislature full discretionary power to decide who the 'permanent residents' of the state are. It gives them special rights and privileges regarding employment with the state government, acquisition of property in the state, settling in the state, and the right to scholarships and other forms of aid that the state government provides. It also allows the state legislature to impose any restrictions upon persons other than the permanent residents regarding the above.

		To guarantee these special rights and privileges, the Article says no act of the state legislature that comes under it can be challenged for violating the Constitution or any other laws.

What will happen if Article 35A is repealed?

		Repealment of Article 35A by the Supreme Court of India or by the government will have some far-reaching implications. Before Article 35A was introduced to the Constitution of India, the Governor and the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir were addressed as the Sadr-e-Riyasat (President) and Wazir-e-Azam (Prime Minister). There's a possibility that if Article 35A is repealed, it would lead J&K back to the same arrangement.

		The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of India would also be curtailed. The legal control of the Centre over Jammu and Kashmir would be limited only to the matters of Defence, External Affairs and Communication.

Which parties are against the removal of Articles 35A and 370

		All Kashmir valley based parties, including the National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (J&KPM) and others are opposed to any tinkering with Articles 35A and 370 that give a special status to J&K. The Congress party also wants these articles to be protected. Congress leaders maintain that senior leaders of the party, including late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had painstakingly worked out J&K's relationship with India through promises made in these articles. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has warned the Centre against the revocation of Article 35A, saying any tinkering with the constitutional provision would be akin to setting a powder keg on fire. Mufti asked her party workers to get ready for a big fight for the protection of Article 35A, which gives special rights and privileges to the state's permanent residents.

		""We want to tell the central government that tinkering with Article 35A will be akin to setting a powder keg on fire,"" the PDP president said. ""If any hand tries to touch Article 35A, not only that hand, but that whole body will be burnt to ashes.""

		Mufti said they would fight till death any attempt to tinker with the state's special status.

Who wants Articles 35A and 370 removed?

		Among the centrist mainstream parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands for abrogation of these articles arguing they are roadblocks not only to the integration of the state with the rest of the country but also in the development of J&K.Rumours are afloat that the Modi-led government is set to scrap Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution.

There's a possibility that if Article 35A is repealed, it would lead J&K back to the same arrangement.The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of India would also be curtailed. The legal control of the Centre over Jammu and Kashmir would be limited only to the matters of Defence, External Affairs and Communication.Which parties are against the removal of Articles 35A and 370All Kashmir valley based parties, including the National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (J&KPM) and others are opposed to any tinkering with Articles 35A and 370 that give a special status to J&K. The Congress party also wants these articles to be protected. Congress leaders maintain that senior leaders of the party, including late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had painstakingly worked out J&K's relationship with India through promises made in these articles. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has warned the Centre against the revocation of Article 35A, saying any tinkering with the constitutional provision would be akin to setting a powder keg on fire. Mufti asked her party workers to get ready for a big fight for the protection of Article 35A, which gives special rights and privileges to the state's permanent residents.""We want to tell the central government that tinkering with Article 35A will be akin to setting a powder keg on fire,"" the PDP president said. ""If any hand tries to touch Article 35A, not only that hand, but that whole body will be burnt to ashes.""Mufti said they would fight till death any attempt to tinker with the state's special status.Who wants Articles 35A and 370 removed?Among the centrist mainstream parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands for abrogation of these articles arguing they are roadblocks not only to the integration of the state with the rest of the country but also in the development of J&K.PREVIOUS STORYNEXT STORYCopyrights © 2019 Business Standard Private Ltd.

"Keep Me Logged InThe Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) is in lockdown after the government revoked a special status granted to the troubled region.On Monday, Interior Minister Amit Shah told India's parliament that the central government would scrap Article 370, a constitutional provision that grants special status and allows the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir to make its own laws. The order was subsequently approved by the Indian President.CNBC takes a look at what this means for Kashmir and for the Muslim-majority state's relationship with India.Article 370 of the Indian constitution carves out a special status to the state of J&K. It also limits the Indian parliament's power to make laws for the state. In effect, the special status, which is described as ""temporary"" allows the state of Jammu & Kashmir to have its own constitution, its own flag and take decisions except for any matter that is related to defense and foreign affairs. The temporary provision was included in the constitution on 17 October, 1949.This special status dates back to the end of British rule in India in 1947 when Maharaja Hari Singh of the then colonized state of Jammu & Kashmir signed a Treaty of Accession for the state of J&K to join the Indian side.Meanwhile, Article 35a, which was added to the constitution in 1954 under Article 370 gives the state of Jammu & Kashmir the right to decide who its permanent residents are. The clause further gives special rights to residents in government jobs, when buying property in the state and for educational scholarships among others.The state defines its permanent residents as those that are ""born or settled within the state before 1911 or after having lawfully acquired immovable property and resident in the state for not less than 10 years before that date.""The law bans non-permanent residents from settling in the state, buying land, and taking government jobs or scholarships.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party had pushed for an end to Kashmir's special constitutional status, arguing that such laws had hindered its integration with the rest of India.India's government wants to strengthen its influence over its only Muslim-majority region.In the run up to the most recent elections in May this year, Modi's Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) had promised a firm policy action to bring peace in the Jammu & Kashmir region.""In the last five years, we have made all necessary efforts to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir through decisive actions and a firm policy. We are committed to overcoming all obstacles that come in the way of development and providing adequate financial resources to all the regions of the state. We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Article 370,"" according to the manifesto.On Monday, Interior Minister Amit Shah introduced the measure in parliament amid massive protests from the opposition as well as regional parties in J&K. Opposition parties have condemned the government's proposal, calling it ""undemocratic.""Shah also said the state will be divided into two union territories – Jammu & Kashmir, which will have its own legislature, and Ladakh, which will be ruled directly by the central government and will have no legislature of its own. A union territory is a type of administrative division in India. Unlike the states of India, which have their own governments, union territories are federal territories governed directly by the main government.India has deployed tens of thousands of troops across the Kashmir valley in anticipation of a backlash of the revoke.Indian authorities banned public movements, shut down schools and colleges indefinitely and put two former chief ministers of J&K — Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti — under house arrest ahead of the announcement.The two leaders took to Twitter to express their disappointment over the decision and warned of consequences.Indian media reports suggest that mobile internet services have been suspended in Kashmir Valley and Satellite phones were being used by security officials.Critics on Twitter have condemned the move, calling it ""authoritarianism."" Indian-author Ramachandra Guha blamed the government for taking action without a proper debate.On Monday, the Pakistan government strongly condemned India for taking ""illegal steps"" in its decision to revoke special status for Kashmir. This according to Reuters, citing a government statement.The Pakistan government also warned that it will ""exercise all possible options.""""As the party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps,"" Pakistan's foreign ministry said in a statement.India and Pakistan's conflict over the mountainous region of Kashmir dates back to 1947 when both countries became independent from British colonial rule.The entire subcontinent was partitioned into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan, which led to a mass displacement as people migrated from one country to the other. Outbreaks of communal and religious violence killed hundreds of thousands of people in the subcontinent during that time.Jammu and Kashmir was a former princely state where a large number of people were killed and others were driven away by the violence during the partition. Since then, India and Pakistan have fought multiple wars over the region — both countries claim the region in full but control only parts of it. Many have raised concerns over violence and human rights abuses in both India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, as well as in Pakistan-controlled Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan region.— CNBC's John Schoen contributed to this report.Got a confidential news tip?

"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action.

During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India.

They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019.

On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends.According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.[268][269][270][271] A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be ""current situation in Kashmir"".[269]According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an ""online misinformation war"".[272] The Nation, in its editorial said, ""The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.""[273]The Indian Home Ministry alleged that ""several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news"", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts.[274] Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors. The demand letter states that such rumors harm the law and order situation and is a ""threat to lives"".[274] They allege that the platform is posting ""objectionable and malicious"" content.[275] Twitter has blocked four of these accounts, and its officials stated that they are reviewing some others.[276] This included the twitter account of Syed Ali Shah Geelani who is a Kashmiri separatist Hurriyat leader.[277]India accused BBC and Reuters of lying and fabricating news about large scale protests in Kashmir even though they were recorded on video.[278] According to India Today, the authenticity of the BBC video about the protest has been questioned because it is an edited combination of a series of clips and it shows an absence of police and security personnel almost everywhere the edited video, even though Kashmir was under a lockdown with heavy security deployment on 9 August 2019 – the day the video was recorded and posted by BBC.[279] According to India Today, a portion of the video is authentically from Dullbagh Road in Srinagar, but it is unclear if it is a fresh video or an old video clip inserted in. Some Indians allege that parts of this video are from Pakistan-adminstered Kashmir.[279]",political,0
"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India.

They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019. This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc

Ghulam Nabi Fai, a Kashmiri diaspora alleged that the Indian plan is ""not only to deprive them [Kashmiris] of their rights but to subjugate them through widespread killings and torture"", while another protester originally hailing from Srinagar stressed that now was the time for the United States to mediate.[255]On 25 August 2019, according to the India Today, the Kashmiri Pandit community in the US held a rally supporting the decision, saying that Article 370 was ""discriminatory"" towards minorities in the Kashmir region.[256] At their rally, they told personal stories of their minority status in the Kashmir valley, the religious discrimination against them, their forced exodus in the 1990s, and they wanting to ""go back to their homeland [valley]"" which they left due to Islamic militancy.[256] At an Atlanta rally, the protestors alleged that the Article 370 was high discriminatory against the resident ""Shias, Dalits, Gujjars, Kashmiri Pandits, Kashmiri Sikhs"" in the state, according to India Today.[256]Many protest demonstrations have been reported in Bangladesh against the change of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[257][258][259] Pakistan's Abb Takk News channel reported that hundreds protested in Dhaka on 6 August 2019 against the Indian move.[257] Again on 7 August 2019, there was another demonstration in the city of Dhaka where the protesters criticized Narendra Modi and his scrapping of autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.[259] There was another demonstration on Thursday 8 August 2019 at the University of Dhaka by several Kashmiri students from different educational institutions.[258] There were more protests on 9 August 2019 after Friday prayers which were led by the Kashmir Solidarity Council Bangladesh.[260]On 12 August, 2019 Bahrain took punitive action against a group of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals who held a protest on the Kashmir decision the previous day.

On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends.According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.[268][269][270][271] A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be ""current situation in Kashmir"".[269]According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an ""online misinformation war"".[272] The Nation, in its editorial said, ""The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.""[273]The Indian Home Ministry alleged that ""several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news"", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts.[274] Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors.

Some Indians allege that parts of this video are from Pakistan-adminstered Kashmir.[279]",political,0
"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India.

They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army.

This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc

"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India. Pakistan's ambassador from India was recalled and the Indian ambassador to Pakistan was expelled.[134] The next day, Pakistan's Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad suspended the Samjhauta Express train service[135] and the Thar Express.[136] The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting decided to ban all cultural exchanges with India, including banning the screening of Indian films and dramas inside Pakistan.[137]Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in a press conference announced that Pakistan will remain committed to open the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikhs despite the tensions and said that ""We are ready to welcome our Sikh brothers and sisters for Baba Guru Nanak's 550th (birth) anniversary"".[138]On 9 August 2019, Pakistan formally suspended its trade relations with India and banned all exports and import to/from India.[139]On 11 August 2019, prime minister Imran Khan compared the Indian government to ""Nazis"", warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be same as ""appeasing Hitler"".[140][141][142] He accused that India was attempting to change the demography of the Muslim majority Kashmir through ethnic cleansing.[140][141][142] He questioned whether the world would watch and appease as they did for Hitler.[140][141][142]Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi issued a statement on Tuesday 13 August 2019 that he had written a letter to the president of the United Nations Security Council with a request to convene an emergency meeting of the council to discuss India's ""illegal actions that violate UN resolutions on Kashmir"".[143] The foreign minister also called for circulation of the letter among members of the Security Council.[143]On 20 August 2019, Pakistan announced that it will take the dispute to the International Court of Justice, adding that its case would centre on alleged human rights violations by India.[144]On 9 August, according to a Reuters report, over 10,000 people protested in Srinagar against Indian government's decision to revoke Article 370, with some protesters pelting stones at government security personnel.[226][227][228] In response, Indian police used tear gas and pellets against the protesters to disperse them.[64] According to Al Jazeera, it has been receiving information from Srinagar residents via satellite phones and Wi-Fi available in the Kashmir region. They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019. This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc

Kashmiri Pandit groups welcomed India's decision, but the Pakistani community in Australia expressed ""deep concern"" regarding the situation in Kashmir. Indian groups in Australia said that this is something India has done internally and Pakistan has no right to interfere in India's internal matters.[265]Geo News reported that the Kashmiri diaspora gathered at the Pariser Platz of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and protested against India on 11 August 2019.[266]A group of protesters in Seoul, South Korea waving Pakistani flags and shouting anti-India slogans along with abuses for Indian PM Narendra Modi was confronted by an Indian delegation including Indian activist Shazia Ilmi. The Indian delegation started to counter the protesters, following which the local police intervened and escorted Shazia Ilmi and her associates from the location.[267]Several human rights activists and world leaders also commented on their social media accounts about the Kashmir situation. On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends.According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.[268][269][270][271] A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be ""current situation in Kashmir"".[269]According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an ""online misinformation war"".[272] The Nation, in its editorial said, ""The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.""[273]The Indian Home Ministry alleged that ""several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news"", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts.[274] Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors. The demand letter states that such rumors harm the law and order situation and is a ""threat to lives"".[274] They allege that the platform is posting ""objectionable and malicious"" content.[275] Twitter has blocked four of these accounts, and its officials stated that they are reviewing some others.[276] This included the twitter account of Syed Ali Shah Geelani who is a Kashmiri separatist Hurriyat leader.[277]India accused BBC and Reuters of lying and fabricating news about large scale protests in Kashmir even though they were recorded on video.[278] According to India Today, the authenticity of the BBC video about the protest has been questioned because it is an edited combination of a series of clips and it shows an absence of police and security personnel almost everywhere the edited video, even though Kashmir was under a lockdown with heavy security deployment on 9 August 2019 – the day the video was recorded and posted by BBC.[279] According to India Today, a portion of the video is authentically from Dullbagh Road in Srinagar, but it is unclear if it is a fresh video or an old video clip inserted in. Some Indians allege that parts of this video are from Pakistan-adminstered Kashmir.[279]",political,0
"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India. Pakistan's ambassador from India was recalled and the Indian ambassador to Pakistan was expelled.[134] The next day, Pakistan's Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad suspended the Samjhauta Express train service[135] and the Thar Express.[136] The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting decided to ban all cultural exchanges with India, including banning the screening of Indian films and dramas inside Pakistan.[137]Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in a press conference announced that Pakistan will remain committed to open the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikhs despite the tensions and said that ""We are ready to welcome our Sikh brothers and sisters for Baba Guru Nanak's 550th (birth) anniversary"".[138]On 9 August 2019, Pakistan formally suspended its trade relations with India and banned all exports and import to/from India.[139]On 11 August 2019, prime minister Imran Khan compared the Indian government to ""Nazis"", warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be same as ""appeasing Hitler"".[140][141][142] He accused that India was attempting to change the demography of the Muslim majority Kashmir through ethnic cleansing.[140][141][142] He questioned whether the world would watch and appease as they did for Hitler.[140][141][142]Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi issued a statement on Tuesday 13 August 2019 that he had written a letter to the president of the United Nations Security Council with a request to convene an emergency meeting of the council to discuss India's ""illegal actions that violate UN resolutions on Kashmir"".[143] The foreign minister also called for circulation of the letter among members of the Security Council.[143]On 20 August 2019, Pakistan announced that it will take the dispute to the International Court of Justice, adding that its case would centre on alleged human rights violations by India.[144]On 9 August, according to a Reuters report, over 10,000 people protested in Srinagar against Indian government's decision to revoke Article 370, with some protesters pelting stones at government security personnel.[226][227][228] In response, Indian police used tear gas and pellets against the protesters to disperse them.[64] According to Al Jazeera, it has been receiving information from Srinagar residents via satellite phones and Wi-Fi available in the Kashmir region. They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019. This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc

A large number of protesters demonstrated outside the Indian embassy in London on Saturday 10 August 2019 to express anger over Indian action.[241][242] There was another demonstration outside the Palace of Westminster on 14 August 2019.[243] A large protest took place outside the Indian High Commission in London on 15 August 2019, where Indians celebrating Indian Independence Day were attacked, and eggs, glass bottles, shoes and other objects were thrown at the High Commission and the people celebrating, by the anti-India protesters, who were mostly British Pakistanis and Sikh extremists.[244][245][246] The protest was allegedly backed by the Inter-Services Intelligence.[247] British PM Boris Johnson later expressed ""regret"" over this violent incident, and assured that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure the safety and security of the embassy, its personnel, and visitors.[248]
On Tuesday 3 September 2019, another violent protest took place outside the Indian High Commission in London, when pro-Pakistan protesters pelted stones and eggs at the embassy building, causing damage to the premises. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan condemned the incident, and tweeted ""I utterly condemn this unacceptable behaviour and have raised this incident with the Metropolitan police to take action.""[249][195] UK's metropolitan police made two arrests for causing criminal damage at the Indian High Commission following the incident.[250] British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the violence towards British Indians while addressing the parliament.[251]There were protest demonstrations outside the Indian consulate in Birmingham on 9 August 2019 to denounce the Indian revocation of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[252] Former member of the British parliament George Galloway was also part of the protest gathering and demanded a plebiscite in Kashmir.[252]A large number of protesters took to streets in Toronto, Canada on 11 August 2019 in support of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.[253] Demonstrators chanted protest slogans and carried placards.[253] The event description read ""Kashmiris do not accept the illegal occupation or unilateral colonial impositions by India. Kashmiris are sovereign Indigenous people who have the right of self-determination and government"".[253]People in Calgary, Canada held a demonstration outside the Calgary City Hall on 8 August 2019 against the clampdown and to support the people of Jammu and Kashmir.[254] The demonstrators said that 800,000 military personnel were deployed in Kashmir and the Internet and communications were blacked out and they did not know what was happening to their families.[254]In the week after India announced the revocation, members of the Kashmiri Muslim community, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn, held a number of protest demonstrations in the United States in the cities of Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle against India's removal of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[255] Protesters also gathered outside the White House on 10 August 2019 and urged Washington to help the people of Kashmir.[255] Pakistan’s ambassador Asad Majeed Khan held community events asking the United States to ""inject some more sanity on the Indian side"". Ghulam Nabi Fai, a Kashmiri diaspora alleged that the Indian plan is ""not only to deprive them [Kashmiris] of their rights but to subjugate them through widespread killings and torture"", while another protester originally hailing from Srinagar stressed that now was the time for the United States to mediate.[255]On 25 August 2019, according to the India Today, the Kashmiri Pandit community in the US held a rally supporting the decision, saying that Article 370 was ""discriminatory"" towards minorities in the Kashmir region.[256] At their rally, they told personal stories of their minority status in the Kashmir valley, the religious discrimination against them, their forced exodus in the 1990s, and they wanting to ""go back to their homeland [valley]"" which they left due to Islamic militancy.[256] At an Atlanta rally, the protestors alleged that the Article 370 was high discriminatory against the resident ""Shias, Dalits, Gujjars, Kashmiri Pandits, Kashmiri Sikhs"" in the state, according to India Today.[256]Many protest demonstrations have been reported in Bangladesh against the change of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[257][258][259] Pakistan's Abb Takk News channel reported that hundreds protested in Dhaka on 6 August 2019 against the Indian move.[257] Again on 7 August 2019, there was another demonstration in the city of Dhaka where the protesters criticized Narendra Modi and his scrapping of autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.[259] There was another demonstration on Thursday 8 August 2019 at the University of Dhaka by several Kashmiri students from different educational institutions.[258] There were more protests on 9 August 2019 after Friday prayers which were led by the Kashmir Solidarity Council Bangladesh.[260]On 12 August, 2019 Bahrain took punitive action against a group of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals who held a protest on the Kashmir decision the previous day. The protest was conducted after Eid al-Adha prayers in Bahrain illegally.[261] The official Twitter handle of the country's Interior Ministry tweeted about the action taken by the local police to contain the protests and also about the legal proceedings being taken against them. Bahrain authorities further requested its citizens to not exploit religious gatherings to further political motives.[262][263]Protests were held in Paris, France on 9 August 2019 to denounce Indian step of abrogation of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[264] The protesters alleged that India was conspiring to change the demography of Kashmir by expelling Kashmiris from their homes and bringing in Hindu settlers from other parts of India.[264]Pro-India and anti-India protesters faced off each other in Melbourne, Australia. Kashmiri Pandit groups welcomed India's decision, but the Pakistani community in Australia expressed ""deep concern"" regarding the situation in Kashmir. Indian groups in Australia said that this is something India has done internally and Pakistan has no right to interfere in India's internal matters.[265]Geo News reported that the Kashmiri diaspora gathered at the Pariser Platz of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and protested against India on 11 August 2019.[266]A group of protesters in Seoul, South Korea waving Pakistani flags and shouting anti-India slogans along with abuses for Indian PM Narendra Modi was confronted by an Indian delegation including Indian activist Shazia Ilmi. The Indian delegation started to counter the protesters, following which the local police intervened and escorted Shazia Ilmi and her associates from the location.[267]Several human rights activists and world leaders also commented on their social media accounts about the Kashmir situation. On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends.According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.[268][269][270][271] A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be ""current situation in Kashmir"".[269]According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an ""online misinformation war"".[272] The Nation, in its editorial said, ""The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.""[273]The Indian Home Ministry alleged that ""several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news"", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts.[274] Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors. The demand letter states that such rumors harm the law and order situation and is a ""threat to lives"".[274] They allege that the platform is posting ""objectionable and malicious"" content.[275] Twitter has blocked four of these accounts, and its officials stated that they are reviewing some others.[276] This included the twitter account of Syed Ali Shah Geelani who is a Kashmiri separatist Hurriyat leader.[277]India accused BBC and Reuters of lying and fabricating news about large scale protests in Kashmir even though they were recorded on video.[278] According to India Today, the authenticity of the BBC video about the protest has been questioned because it is an edited combination of a series of clips and it shows an absence of police and security personnel almost everywhere the edited video, even though Kashmir was under a lockdown with heavy security deployment on 9 August 2019 – the day the video was recorded and posted by BBC.[279] According to India Today, a portion of the video is authentically from Dullbagh Road in Srinagar, but it is unclear if it is a fresh video or an old video clip inserted in. Some Indians allege that parts of this video are from Pakistan-adminstered Kashmir.[279]",political,0
"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India. Pakistan's ambassador from India was recalled and the Indian ambassador to Pakistan was expelled.[134] The next day, Pakistan's Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad suspended the Samjhauta Express train service[135] and the Thar Express.[136] The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting decided to ban all cultural exchanges with India, including banning the screening of Indian films and dramas inside Pakistan.[137]Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in a press conference announced that Pakistan will remain committed to open the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikhs despite the tensions and said that ""We are ready to welcome our Sikh brothers and sisters for Baba Guru Nanak's 550th (birth) anniversary"".[138]On 9 August 2019, Pakistan formally suspended its trade relations with India and banned all exports and import to/from India.[139]On 11 August 2019, prime minister Imran Khan compared the Indian government to ""Nazis"", warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be same as ""appeasing Hitler"".[140][141][142] He accused that India was attempting to change the demography of the Muslim majority Kashmir through ethnic cleansing.[140][141][142] He questioned whether the world would watch and appease as they did for Hitler.[140][141][142]Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi issued a statement on Tuesday 13 August 2019 that he had written a letter to the president of the United Nations Security Council with a request to convene an emergency meeting of the council to discuss India's ""illegal actions that violate UN resolutions on Kashmir"".[143] The foreign minister also called for circulation of the letter among members of the Security Council.[143]On 20 August 2019, Pakistan announced that it will take the dispute to the International Court of Justice, adding that its case would centre on alleged human rights violations by India.[144]On 9 August, according to a Reuters report, over 10,000 people protested in Srinagar against Indian government's decision to revoke Article 370, with some protesters pelting stones at government security personnel.[226][227][228] In response, Indian police used tear gas and pellets against the protesters to disperse them.[64] According to Al Jazeera, it has been receiving information from Srinagar residents via satellite phones and Wi-Fi available in the Kashmir region. They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019. This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc

On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends.According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.[268][269][270][271] A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be ""current situation in Kashmir"".[269]According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an ""online misinformation war"".[272] The Nation, in its editorial said, ""The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.""[273]The Indian Home Ministry alleged that ""several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news"", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts.[274] Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Narendra Modi government on Monday moved to dramatically alter the status quo in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government ended days of speculation by making public its decision to effectively revoke the controversial Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.Article 370 accords special status to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag and rights. On Monday morning, home minister Amit Shah rose in Rajya Sabha to announce that the government was moving a Presidential order for Parliament's ratification.The Presidential order used a clause of Article 370 to say that provisions of Article 370 would no longer be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir, a move that essentially revokes the article without actually doing so.In a follow-up, but equally bold move, Amit Shah also said the government was moving a bill to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories -- Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. While the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir would have a legislature, a la Delhi, Ladakh would not.The Narendra Modi government's historic decision on Jammu and Kashmir, which ranks among the most unprecedented political moves in the country, will be debated for days, even weeks to come. Here is everything you need to know about what happened on Monday.What did the government do today?The government today moved a resolution to effectively abolish Article 370, which gives special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government also introduced a Bill to divide the state into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh.So Jammu and Kashmir is no longer a state?Short answer: Not yet. The Rajya Sabha has passed the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill which bifurcates the state into two Union territories. The Lok Sabha (where the BJP has a brute majority) now must pass the Bill, which will then go to the President for his assent. Once the President signs the Bill and the government issues a notification, Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be a state.READ | Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh: This is how the redrawn map will look likeBasically:And, what about Article 370? Has it been scrapped?Technically: No. As of now, the government has used a clause within Article 370 to make the provisions of the article inoperative.Let us explain.READ | How govt used Article 370 to kill Article 370What even is Article 370?Article 370 is an enabling provision. It explains which parts of the Indian Constitution have jurisdiction over Jammu and Kashmir, which adopted a separate state constitution for itself during the 1950s.According to it, the Central government needs the concurrence of J&K state government for applying laws. Now that changes.READ | Article 370 has not been scrapped. What does Modi govt move on Kashmir mean?So what happens to Article 35A?Article 35A, making a distinction between the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir and the outsiders, will also cease to have any effect in Jammu and Kashmir.Why did the government move to revoke the powers of Article 370?Revoking Article 370 of the Constitution has been a key part of the BJP's core agenda and has always struck an emotional chord with its rank and file after its ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee died in a Jammu and Kashmir jail in 1953 to protest the state's special status and demand its complete integration with the Union.Apart from ideology, the Modi government:Has anybody supported the Modi government on its Article 370 move?Yes, apart from NDA allies Shiv Sena, RPI, Akali Dal and others, regional parties like BSP, AAP, BJD, TRS and AIADMK extended full support to the resolution to effectively scrap Article 370 and the Bill to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir. You can read all about that here.How has the Valley reacted to these developments?Since communication in the Valley is currently snapped, there are no first-person reports from the ground.The situation in Kashmir Valley appeared to be ""under control"" as no untoward incident was reported on Monday.However, this can be attributed to the fact authorities have imposed curfew in Kishtwar and Rajouri districts and in the Banihal area of Ramban district, while restrictions were imposed in many districts of Jammu division and Srinagar.NOTE: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, who were under house arrest since Sunday night, have been arrested. Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference leaders Sajjad Lone and Imran Ansari have also been arrested.What is the Opposition saying on these developments related to Jammu and Kashmir?Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement evoked strong protests from the opposition with leaders of Congress, TMC, DMK, NCP and Left raising slogans and storming the well of the House.Some opposition parties termed the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two union territories as a ""black spot"". While Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad Monday said that the state's head, considered as India's crown, has been ""chopped off"" and its identity removed, TMC MP Derek O'Brien said that the Centre was committing ""procedural harakiri"".READ | Today we lost Kashmir: Kapil Sibal accuses govt of evading debate on Article 370Why were all eyes on Amit Shah today?READ | J&K to become state again when the time is right, says Amit ShahSo, what's next for Jammu and Kashmir?Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe biggest decision of the Narendra Modi government came shortly after 50 days of the beginning of its second term. The government on Monday moved Parliament to remove the special status provision to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, revoking 1954 Presidential proclamation through a gazette notification.With that revocation order, Article 35A no longer exists. The article defined the permanent resident of Jammu and Kashmir and also defined the state's relationship with the Centre, and barred non-permanent residents from permanently settling in J&K. It also gives rights of buying immovable property, acquiring land, applying for government jobs, any kind of scholarships and aids, and other public welfare projects to state domicile.Once the President revokes the order, the special status of the status will be withdrawn. This paves way for what the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long believed - Ek Nishan, Ek Vidhan aur Ek Pradhan (One flag, one Constitution and one leader).Here are some of the significant changes in Jammu and Kashmir:1. J&K Constitution scrappedBefore Article 370 - It was the only state with its own Constitution.

"Women, Dalits, tribals and minorities of Jammu and Kashmir are now equal citizens of IndiaSince 5 August, when the government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), the floodgates of righteous rage from the usual suspects from India and the rest of the world have opened. Hardly surprising. This was the jackboot, the blood-soaked end of democracy, a rape of the Constitution, the trampling of fundamental rights of Kashmiris, and so on. These hyperventilating flag-bearers of freedom (or whatever) should calm down and consider one historical fact. Which is this. The “temporary and transitional"" provision Article 370 made an exception to the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Indian Constitution. These fundamental rights have now been restored. And this is shockingly easy to explain.A New York Times columnist has wailed that the government has now converted “the people of Kashmir to second-class citizens, if not subjects"". Sorry, but the truth is that some of these people—specifically the male Kashmiri Muslim—enjoyed far greater rights than any other Indian citizen; they have now been brought down to equal status. And many other inhabitants of the erstwhile state had fewer rights than normal Indian citizens; they have been granted equality. One would think that anyone who believed in democracy would see that as a good thing.To explain this, we must come to “majoritarianism"", over which much chest-beating is going on. Some people have seen the government’s action as “unabashed majoritarianism"". Whereas, if there ever was any unabashed and constitutionally sanctioned majoritarianism anywhere in India, it was in J&K through Article 370. The Constitution of this Muslim-majority state did not have the word “minorities"" anywhere in it. Unlike in the Indian Constitution, their rights were not protected. J&K was also the only Indian state with no tribal rights (and the state had no right to education either). And it should be our national shame that we allow these hypocrites to freely talk of majoritarianism while staying silent about the 20th century’s swiftest forced exodus of a minority community—Hindu Pandits from Kashmir in 1990.There is extensive scare-mongering that the removal of Article 35A will lead to land grab by non-Kashmiris, because the law permitted ownership of immovable property in the state only by permanent residents (PRs). But this law also stipulated that J&K women who married non-PRs, lost their PR status and inheritance rights. When we spoke to an old family friend, a Kashmiri lady engineer married to a non-Kashmiri, who played a key role in the Chandrayaan-2 launch, she was tearful; all she could think of was building a little home in her homeland. Article 35A also ensured that the thousands of descendants of Valmikis (Dalits) who were brought in from Punjab as government sweepers in 1957 were never allowed to get any government jobs other than sweepers. And they could not even get a Scheduled Caste certificate from the state government, so were not eligible for any benefits under central schemes. Hindu and Sikh refugees from West Pakistan remained non-PR second-class citizens, while Uighur Muslims from Xinjiang were granted PR status. And we are supposed to believe that Kashmiri Muslims have become second-class citizens, when in reality, actual second-class citizens now have full citizen rights.Majoritarianism? Watch the video of Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal’s Lok Sabha speech on 6 August to know what majoritarian oppression means to a religious and ethnic minority. Fear is being spread about the government plotting demographic change in Kashmir, like China settling Han Chinese in Tibet. But systematic attempts to change demography have been in progress for years in J&K, through settling Muslims in Buddhist-majority Ladakh (Namgyal mentioned this), and recently, Rohingyas in Jammu.The vast majority of Indians have never understood why J&K deserved special status, and certainly Sardar Patel and B.R. Ambedkar were vehemently opposed to Article 370. Patel told his secretary, V. Shankar: “Jawaharlal royega (Jawaharlal will weep over this)"", and Ambedkar refused to attend the session that passed the motion. And the fact that many Opposition parties supported the revocation, that even Congress is divided over it, obviously indicates that politicians know that the people of our democratic republic feel that it’s time for all Indians to be equal citizens.The real test begins now. With J&K a Union territory, the central government must ensure that funds are deployed properly and don’t line the pockets of a few families and their cronies. However, it will take time before industry feels that the valley is a safe bet. Pakistan will try to up its terrorist game. Also, when the US withdraws its troops from Afghanistan, some of the Taliban’s resources will be available to Pakistan to be re-directed towards Kashmir. But, most importantly, the doubting Kashmiri Muslim must realize that Article 370 made him special in a very negative way. It kept him alienated from his nation for seven decades. No Malayali, Gujarati, Assamese, and no Dogra or Ladakhi has lost his identity because he is an Indian. India has opened her arms. It is now up to sceptical Kashmiris to accept the offer.Sandipan Deb is a former editor of ‘Financial Express’, and founder-editor of ‘Open’ and ‘Swarajya’ magazinesLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIndia's BJP-led government is hailing its decision to strip the state of Jammu and Kashmir of autonomy after seven decades, characterising it as the correction of a ""historical blunder"". The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi explains why this has happened and why it's important.Kashmir is a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan say is fully theirs.The area was once a princely state called Jammu and Kashmir, but it joined India in 1947 soon after the sub-continent was divided up at the end of British rule.India and Pakistan subsequently went to war over it and each came to control different parts of the territory with a ceasefire line agreed.There has been violence in the Indian-administered side - the state of Jammu and Kashmir - for 30 years due to a separatist insurgency against Indian rule.In the first few days of August, there were signs of something afoot in Kashmir.Tens of thousands of additional Indian troops were deployed, a major Hindu pilgrimage was cancelled, schools and colleges were shut, tourists were ordered to leave, telephone and internet services were suspended and regional political leaders were placed under house arrest.But most of the speculation was that Article 35A of the Indian constitution, which gave some special privileges to the people of the state, would be scrapped.The government then stunned everyone by saying it was revoking nearly all of Article 370, which 35A is part of and which has been the basis of Kashmir's complex relationship with India for some 70 years.The article allowed the state a certain amount of autonomy - its own constitution, a separate flag and freedom to make laws. Foreign affairs, defence and communications remained the preserve of the central government.As a result, Jammu and Kashmir could make its own rules relating to permanent residency, ownership of property and fundamental rights. It could also bar Indians from outside the state from purchasing property or settling there.The constitutional provision has underpinned India's often fraught relationship with Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority region to join India at partition.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party had long opposed Article 370 and revoking it was in the party's 2019 election manifesto.They argued it needed to be scrapped to integrate Kashmir and put it on the same footing as the rest of India. After returning to power with a massive mandate in the April-May general elections, the government lost no time in acting on its pledge.Critics of Monday's move are linking it to the economic slowdown that India is currently facing - they say it provides a much-needed diversion for the government.Many Kashmiris believe that the BJP ultimately wants to change the demographic character of the Muslim-majority region by allowing non-Kashmiris to buy land there.Although Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement in parliament on Monday came as a surprise to most Indians, it would have taken the government some preparation to arrive at the decision.The move also fits in with Mr Modi's desire to show that the BJP is tough on Kashmir, and Pakistan.Kashmir will no longer have a separate constitution but will have to abide by the Indian constitution much like any other state.All Indian laws will be automatically applicable to Kashmiris, and people from outside the state will be able to buy property there.The government says this will bring development to the region.""I want to tell the people of Jammu and Kashmir what damage Articles 370 and 35A did to the state,"" Mr Shah told parliament. ""It's because of these sections that democracy was never fully implemented, corruption increased in the state, that no development could take place.""The government is also moving to break up the state into two smaller, federally administered territories. One region will combine Muslim-majority Kashmir and Hindu-majority Jammu. The other is Buddhist-majority Ladakh, which is culturally and historically close to Tibet.P Chidambaram, a senior leader in the opposition Congress Party described the decision as a ""catastrophic step"" and warned in parliament that it could have serious consequences.""You may think you have scored a victory, but you are wrong and history will prove you to be wrong. Future generations will realise what a grave mistake this house is making today,"" he said.According to the constitution, Article 370 could only be modified with the agreement of the ""state government"". But there hasn't been much of a state government in Jammu and Kashmir for over a year now.In June last year, India imposed federal rule after the government of the then chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, was reduced to a minority. This meant the federal government only had to seek the consent of the governor who imposes its rule.The government says it is well within its rights to bring in the changes and that similar decisions have been taken by federal governments in the past.But expert opinion is sharply divided.One constitutional expert, Subhash Kashyap, told news agency ANI that the order was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".However another constitutional expert, AG Noorani, told BBC Hindi it was ""an illegal decision, akin to committing fraud"" that could be challenged in the Supreme Court.Opposition political parties could launch a legal challenge but Kashmir is an emotive issue with many Indians, and most parties would be wary of opposing the move lest they be branded anti-India.That could leave any challenge up to individuals or activists.Lt Col Alexander Vindman listened to the phone call that sparked the impeachment inquiry against the US president.Have you been getting these songs wrong?What happens to your body in extreme heat?",political,0

The government has, however, said that these are precautionary measures in view of terrorist threats. Meanwhile, various political leaders including former Chief Ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti have been placed under house arrest. Mobile internet services have also been barred.

What are Article 370 and 35A? Are they amendable? If abrogated can it solve the long standing political dispute in Jammu and Kashmir?

Here's an explainer on Article 35A and 370

Article 370 grants an autonomous status to J&K, while Article 35A, incorporated into the Constitution in 1954, provides special rights and privileges to the citizens of the state.

What the two articles mean:

Article 370

History

		In October 1947, the then-Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir signed the ‘Instrument of Accession’, which specified three subjects on which Jammu and Kashmir would transfer its powers to the government of India: 1. Foreign affairs, 2. Defence and 3. Communications. In March 1948, the Maharaja appointed an interim government in the state, with Sheikh Abdullah as the prime minister. In July 1949, Sheikh Abdullah and three other colleagues joined the Indian Constituent Assembly and negotiated the special status of J&K, leading to the adoption of Article 370. The controversial provision was drafted by Sheikh Abdullah.

What are the provisions of Article 370?

		Parliament needs the Jammu & Kashmir government's nod for applying laws in the state — except defence, foreign affairs, finance, and communications.

		The law of citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights of the residents of Jammu & Kashmir is different from the residents living in rest of India. Under Article 370, citizens from other states cannot buy property in Jammu & Kashmir. Under Article 370, the Centre has no power to declare financial emergency.

		It is important to note Article 370(1)(c) explicitly mentions that Article 1 of the Indian Constitution applies to Kashmir through Article 370. Article 1 lists the states of the Union. This means that it is Article 370 that binds the state of J&K to the Indian Union. Removing Article 370, which can be done by a Presidential Order, would therefore make the state independent of India.

Temporary provision or not?

		A petition filed by Kumari Vijayalakshmi Jha challenged the validity of Article 370 against the Delhi High Court's April 11, 2017 order. The petition had said that the continuance of the temporary provision of Article 370 even after dissolution of Constituent Assembly of J&K, and that of J&K Constitution, which has never got the assent of the President of India or Parliament or the government of India, ""amounts to fraud on the basic structure of our Constitution"".

Article 35A

What is it?

		Article 35A gives the Jammu & Kashmir Legislature full discretionary power to decide who the 'permanent residents' of the state are. It gives them special rights and privileges regarding employment with the state government, acquisition of property in the state, settling in the state, and the right to scholarships and other forms of aid that the state government provides. It also allows the state legislature to impose any restrictions upon persons other than the permanent residents regarding the above.

		To guarantee these special rights and privileges, the Article says no act of the state legislature that comes under it can be challenged for violating the Constitution or any other laws.

What will happen if Article 35A is repealed?

		Repealment of Article 35A by the Supreme Court of India or by the government will have some far-reaching implications. Before Article 35A was introduced to the Constitution of India, the Governor and the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir were addressed as the Sadr-e-Riyasat (President) and Wazir-e-Azam (Prime Minister). There's a possibility that if Article 35A is repealed, it would lead J&K back to the same arrangement.

		The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of India would also be curtailed. The legal control of the Centre over Jammu and Kashmir would be limited only to the matters of Defence, External Affairs and Communication.

Which parties are against the removal of Articles 35A and 370

		All Kashmir valley based parties, including the National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (J&KPM) and others are opposed to any tinkering with Articles 35A and 370 that give a special status to J&K. The Congress party also wants these articles to be protected. Congress leaders maintain that senior leaders of the party, including late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had painstakingly worked out J&K's relationship with India through promises made in these articles. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has warned the Centre against the revocation of Article 35A, saying any tinkering with the constitutional provision would be akin to setting a powder keg on fire. Mufti asked her party workers to get ready for a big fight for the protection of Article 35A, which gives special rights and privileges to the state's permanent residents.

		""We want to tell the central government that tinkering with Article 35A will be akin to setting a powder keg on fire,"" the PDP president said. ""If any hand tries to touch Article 35A, not only that hand, but that whole body will be burnt to ashes.""

		Mufti said they would fight till death any attempt to tinker with the state's special status.

Who wants Articles 35A and 370 removed?

		Among the centrist mainstream parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands for abrogation of these articles arguing they are roadblocks not only to the integration of the state with the rest of the country but also in the development of J&K.Rumours are afloat that the Modi-led government is set to scrap Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution.

"Keep Me Logged InThe Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) is in lockdown after the government revoked a special status granted to the troubled region.On Monday, Interior Minister Amit Shah told India's parliament that the central government would scrap Article 370, a constitutional provision that grants special status and allows the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir to make its own laws. The order was subsequently approved by the Indian President.CNBC takes a look at what this means for Kashmir and for the Muslim-majority state's relationship with India.Article 370 of the Indian constitution carves out a special status to the state of J&K. It also limits the Indian parliament's power to make laws for the state. In effect, the special status, which is described as ""temporary"" allows the state of Jammu & Kashmir to have its own constitution, its own flag and take decisions except for any matter that is related to defense and foreign affairs. The temporary provision was included in the constitution on 17 October, 1949.This special status dates back to the end of British rule in India in 1947 when Maharaja Hari Singh of the then colonized state of Jammu & Kashmir signed a Treaty of Accession for the state of J&K to join the Indian side.Meanwhile, Article 35a, which was added to the constitution in 1954 under Article 370 gives the state of Jammu & Kashmir the right to decide who its permanent residents are. The clause further gives special rights to residents in government jobs, when buying property in the state and for educational scholarships among others.The state defines its permanent residents as those that are ""born or settled within the state before 1911 or after having lawfully acquired immovable property and resident in the state for not less than 10 years before that date.""The law bans non-permanent residents from settling in the state, buying land, and taking government jobs or scholarships.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party had pushed for an end to Kashmir's special constitutional status, arguing that such laws had hindered its integration with the rest of India.India's government wants to strengthen its influence over its only Muslim-majority region.In the run up to the most recent elections in May this year, Modi's Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) had promised a firm policy action to bring peace in the Jammu & Kashmir region.""In the last five years, we have made all necessary efforts to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir through decisive actions and a firm policy. We are committed to overcoming all obstacles that come in the way of development and providing adequate financial resources to all the regions of the state. We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Article 370,"" according to the manifesto.On Monday, Interior Minister Amit Shah introduced the measure in parliament amid massive protests from the opposition as well as regional parties in J&K. Opposition parties have condemned the government's proposal, calling it ""undemocratic.""Shah also said the state will be divided into two union territories – Jammu & Kashmir, which will have its own legislature, and Ladakh, which will be ruled directly by the central government and will have no legislature of its own. A union territory is a type of administrative division in India. Unlike the states of India, which have their own governments, union territories are federal territories governed directly by the main government.India has deployed tens of thousands of troops across the Kashmir valley in anticipation of a backlash of the revoke.Indian authorities banned public movements, shut down schools and colleges indefinitely and put two former chief ministers of J&K — Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti — under house arrest ahead of the announcement.The two leaders took to Twitter to express their disappointment over the decision and warned of consequences.Indian media reports suggest that mobile internet services have been suspended in Kashmir Valley and Satellite phones were being used by security officials.Critics on Twitter have condemned the move, calling it ""authoritarianism."" Indian-author Ramachandra Guha blamed the government for taking action without a proper debate.On Monday, the Pakistan government strongly condemned India for taking ""illegal steps"" in its decision to revoke special status for Kashmir. This according to Reuters, citing a government statement.The Pakistan government also warned that it will ""exercise all possible options.""""As the party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps,"" Pakistan's foreign ministry said in a statement.India and Pakistan's conflict over the mountainous region of Kashmir dates back to 1947 when both countries became independent from British colonial rule.The entire subcontinent was partitioned into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan, which led to a mass displacement as people migrated from one country to the other. Outbreaks of communal and religious violence killed hundreds of thousands of people in the subcontinent during that time.Jammu and Kashmir was a former princely state where a large number of people were killed and others were driven away by the violence during the partition. Since then, India and Pakistan have fought multiple wars over the region — both countries claim the region in full but control only parts of it. Many have raised concerns over violence and human rights abuses in both India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, as well as in Pakistan-controlled Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan region.— CNBC's John Schoen contributed to this report.Got a confidential news tip?

"Holding placards against the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370, the two MPs urged the government to ""respect"" the special status of the region.The national capital witnessed a dip in pollution levels on November 16 morning even as the air quality in the city remained in the ""severe"" category.The trial runs, through the restive south Kashmir, were done after a thorough safety audit of the section, a railway official told PTI.Attributing the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to Modi's political will and Amit Shah's strategy, Nadda said by uprooting a ""70-year-old cancer"" within a month of coming to power for a second term, the prime minister has shown how a strong government works.BJP working president JP Nadda asked party functionaries to expose the ""blatant lie"" of Congress leaders which has hurt the country's image abroad, by raising questions on the transparency of defence deals in India.A 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice N V Ramana said that passing any interim order might lead to delay in the matter and the apex court would settle all the issues at one go after hearing all the parties.Article 35A became history on August 5 as a consequence of the Centre's decision to abrogate the provisions of Article 370 which had given special status to the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir.Addressing a press conference here, Congress spokesman Pawan Kheda said, ""Not once or twice, but the Congress party diluted article 370 as many as 12 times, but without letting any controversy break out.""Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday transitioned from a state into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, nearly three months after the NDA government abrogated the state's special status.The stick has been used to good effect, it’s now time to use the carrot .While bureaucratic structures are in place, the staff of the state administration is yet to be dividedReal estate experts feel it is still too early to gauge the real impact on Kashmir's real estate market. As of now, it is still a highly sensitive region and security concerns may keep property buyers at bay.The 59-year-old, who happens to be one of the youngest governors the country has had, has been a trusted aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi since the time he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.Reacting sharply to India's move to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to bring it in line with the rest of the country, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian envoy.India and Saudi Arabia are re-defining their foreign policy priorities: For New Delhi, Saudi Arabia and the Arab Gulf states are becoming key interlocutors in the Middle East. For Riyadh, India is one of the eight major powers with which it wants to forge strategic partnerships as part of its Vision 2030.The two UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh come into existence on Thursday after the central government on August 5 decided to abrogate the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and create them on October 31.Shah also said Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's unfullfilled dream of integrating Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country was accomplished on August 5 when Article 370 and 35A were repealed.The total number of states in India is now 28, while the total UTs will has gone up to nine""The CPI(M) reiterates its strong opposition to the abrogation of Sec 370 as well as the division and reduced status of the State of Jammu & Kashmir,"" the Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said in a press statement.Chowdhury, who is also a five-time MP from Berhampore Lok Sabha seat in Murshidabad district, on Wednesday met family members of the five labourers who were killed by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.He called upon the ""learned"" journalists to do a thorough scanning of past 30 years of militancy and find out on how many occasions the internet was suspended.For now, the additional troops have been lodged in tents, government facilities, under-construction buildings, warehouses, abandoned homes and yatri campsDuring the two-day visit, the EU MPs are expected to be briefed by government officials on the prevailing situation in the Kashmir Valley as well as other parts of J&K.This comes as a diplomatic outreach by the Centre to counter Pakistan's narrative on the situation in the Kashmir Valley and to provide a ""clear view"" of India's development and governance priorities""I am surprised that the MEA has arranged for European Union MPs, in their private capacity [Not EU's official delegation], to visit Kashmir area of J&K. This is a perversion of our national policy. I urge the government cancel this visit because it is immoral,"" Swamy said.Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Barely 48 hours after the BJP pulled out of the alliance with the PDP in Kashmir, online debates on revoking Article 370 have gathered steam. BJP MP in Rajya Sabha Subramanian Swamy in a tweet Wednesday claimed to have written to the PMO on “why Article 370 can be deleted without Parliament concurrence, and by a Presidential concurrence”.ThePrint asks – Article 370: Can Modi revoke it before 2019 and will it heal or hit Kashmir’s ties with rest of India?R. Jagannathan
Editorial director, SwarajyaArticle 370 needs to be revoked for a simple reason –whatever be the historical reasons for its insertion into the Constitution, we can’t have a situation where some states are more equal than the others.It is an abomination because the only real reason it is there is because Jammu and Kashmir happens to have a Muslim majority. It actually sends a wrong message to the Hindu majority for it confirms their belief that minorities can get away with anything. But the essence of Article 370, which means giving states more powers, should be extended to all states. If this balancing is done, neither Kashmiris nor the rest of the Indian states should have a reason to complain.The BJP cannot possibly unilaterally repeal it, especially in the context of 2019, because the opposition is building an anti-BJP coalition to defeat it. It would cleave the nation like never before.Ideally, Article 370 should be repealed by Parliament, but then we have the precedent of Article 35A, which was inserted without parliamentary approval. The BJP could well ask: If Article 35A can be brought in through executive effort alone, why can’t Article 370 go the same way? However, unilateral repeal will alienate Kashmiri Muslims, who think Article 370 is the bare minimum they can accept to remain in India.It is possible for the BJP to help polarise voters by making Article 370’s repeal a core issue for 2019. But outside Kashmir, it has relatively low resonance, and a shift back to basic ideology – which it was willing to sacrifice for power in Jammu and Kashmir – will sound opportunistic.So, while the article must go in some time, 2019 is not the time to go full steam ahead with its repeal.Aman M. Hingorani
Advocate on Record & Mediator, Supreme Court and author of Unravelling the Kashmir KnotArticle 370 reflects the terms of the instrument of accession executed by the sovereign ruler of Jammu and Kashmir in favour of India on 26 October 1947, whereby only the areas of external affairs, communication and defence were ceded to India.Article 370 preserves the state’s autonomy and leaves it to the state’s Constituent Assembly to further determine its constitutional relationship with India. Indeed, the recommendation of the state’s Constituent Assembly is required under Article 370(3) before the President can declare the article inoperative. The present government, being a creation of the Indian Constitution, is bound by these terms.Now, the state’s Constituent Assembly, set up by its sovereign ruler in 1951, dispersed after framing the state’s Constitution in 1957 and without making any recommendation qua Article 370. Hence, the competence of New Delhi to declare Article 370 inoperative no longer exists, thus rendering this debate irrelevant. Nor would any attempt to equate the state’s Constituent Assembly, referred to in Article 370, with the state legislative assembly come to New Delhi’s rescue because that would make a mockery of New Delhi’s commitment to the state to preserve its autonomy as a pre-condition to its accession to India.My book ‘Unravelling the Kashmir Knot’ details how such commitment has nonetheless been progressively eroded by emasculating Article 370 beyond recognition so that it does not come in the way of New Delhi dealing with the state in any manner it chooses – a regrettable state of affairs that continues till date.Hakim Yasir Abbas
Assistant professor, School of Law
University of KashmirSubramanian Swamy’s recent tweet about Article 370 while being correct is far from being the complete truth. He is right when he says that revoking Article 370 only requires a Presidential notification of a cabinet resolution.Swamy, however, fails to inform his 7.37 million Twitter followers that while he is accusing others of being ignorant of the Constitution, the same Constitution provides in Clause 3 of Article 370 that such notification cannot happen without the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Therefore, the power given to the President to revoke Article 370 is not something that the President can invoke unilaterally on behest of the Prime Minister and his cabinet.Had that been the case, the BJP would have been able to revoke Article 370 as soon as it came to power in 2014 and, more so, when it formed the coalition government with the PDP in 2015. Its failure to do so is also the reason why attempts have been made to exploit the judicial machinery to scrap Article 370 (and Article 35A). The BJP is trying to use the courts in order to circumvent the barrier created by Clause 3 of Article 370.However, assuming that the BJP is able to revoke Article 370 on its own, doing so would have serious repercussions as far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned. While the BJP may (legally) achieve territorial integration, such integration will be devoid of any political and demographical mandate. Kashmir will integrate, but Kashmiris (including those who are part of mainstream political demography) will be alienated.Arjimand Hussain Talib
Editor-in-chief, Ziraat TimesIt is not possible to revoke Article 370 and there are firm constitutional and technical grounds for that.The idea of revoking it does, understandably, excite the BJP’s political constituency. Little wonder the party had made a promise to scrap the law in its 2014 election manifesto.At the outset of forming a coalition government with the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir in 2014, the BJP committed itself to safeguard the Article 370 in its agenda of alliance.Then came the watershed development on 4 April 2018 when the Supreme Court bench, consisting of Justices Adarsh K. Goel and R.F. Nariman, observed that “it is impossible to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, conferring special status on Jammu and Kashmir, because it has acquired permanent status through [its] years of existence.”Now let us assume that the Modi government moots a proposal in the Parliament under Article 368 ahead of the 2019 elections to abrogate Article 370. It can, but any amendment to the article will not apply to Jammu and Kashmir without the ratification of the state’s legislative assembly.Moreover, in conjunction with Article 370, the presidential order for 1954 provided that no bill to increase or diminish the area of Jammu and Kashmir, or altering its name or the boundaries, can be introduced in Parliament without the consent of the state legislature.It is possible that by keeping the state assembly under suspended animation, the BJP is planning the formation of a government, with certain permutations and combinations in Jammu and Kashmir, which is favourable to such a situation.National Conference leader and former CM Omar Abdullah said on 17 April 2014 that “accession will end if Article 370 is scrapped because the accession is dependent on it”.Senior PDP leader and constitutional lawyer Muzaffar Hussain Beig is of the opinion that the Article 1, under which Jammu and Kashmir is included as a territory of India, has been applied to the state under Article 370 and that if Article 370 goes, Article 1 will automatically cease to apply to the state.Given the slide in the BJP’s popularity and its electoral prospects in 2019, it is possible that the party is contemplating an attempt towards abrogation of Article 370. Such a course would be a disaster for the prospects of durable peace and stability in Jammu & Kashmir. It could also mark an irretrievable trough in the New Delhi-Srinagar relationship.Junaid Mattu
Spokesperson, National ConferenceThe revocation of Article 370 has been and will continue to be the go-to rallying point for the hard-core nationalist narrative, especially ahead of the general elections.This rallying cry doesn’t hinge on constitutional or political realities so the question of the Article’s revocation is purely theoretical – again distorted and supported by half-baked reasoning. The Article apart from being a constitutional chord between the Union and the state is also perhaps the only political basis on which the state builds its rationale for the continued status of its dignified existence within the Union.While I am of the strong belief that the revocation of the Article is beyond the constitutional and legislative reach of the Union, the country’s institutions lately have sprung up many surprises that redefine the probability of such a misadventure. People in Jammu and Kashmir have been weary of such designs since 2013 when the BJP manifesto clearly mentioned the revocation of Article 370 as a cornerstone of its Kashmir policy.This sense of anxiety within the state has been further fuelled by regular statements from senior BJP leaders supporting the revocation. The disillusionment in the Valley has been in part stoked by repeated attempts to distort and villainise the state’s special status as a challenge to the Union’s integrity. Nothing could be farther from the truth. However, this narrative has not allowed constitutionality or the possible implications of such a step in the state to get in its way.Any assault on the remnants of the special status will destroy whatever little credibility Jammu and Kashmir and its institutions have left in the State. Those who believe the revocation of Article 370 will facilitate ‘integration’ are oblivious to the genesis of the turmoil in Kashmir in 1953 – which has manifested itself in recurring periods of conflict.As the state continues to be on the brink after three years of misrule and ideological U-turns, even an indication of a judicial or legislative review of Article 370 could be the tipping point – and this time around the turmoil would be unprecedented.Mehboob Beg
PDP SpokespersonSupreme Court, who is the last word on legal subjects, has delivered a judgment on Article 370, saying the fundamentals of the Indian Constitution can neither be amended and nor can there be any question of revoking it. For me, Article 370 forms the fundamentals of Jammu and Kashmir’s relationship with the Union. And if one starts tampering with the basics, it will open up Pandora’s box. It would mean that one is questioning the relationship itself.The ground situation in Kashmir says loud and clear that people want more federal powers than they have right now. Mehbooba Mufti is right when she says that a muscular policy will not help solve the Kashmir tangle, and we must treat the state as our own.The weakening of Article 370 will weaken the people of Kashmir. Revocation of the article is wishful thinking which cannot happen legally. J&K is the only state which negotiated its relationship with the Union. These legal protections form the basis of such a relationship.One can expect anything from Subramanian Swamy. He is entitled to his will but Article 370 has political undertones. We are proud of being part of a secular, democratic India which gave us certain legal guarantees. We rejected a theocratic state like Pakistan, and that was always an option. Maharaja Hari Singh perhaps didn’t want to join India, but we being Muslims still wanted to join a secular India. Why did Swamy pick on Jammu and Kashmir? He should follow Vajpayee ji’s ideals for peace in the Valley, if not our advice.Apurva Vishwananth
Special Correspondent, ThePrintThe political ground for Article 370 has been shaky under the Modi government and the unease in the state is now at its worst. The government is unlikely to shy away from reviving the debate.Abrogating the provision was in the BJP’s 2014 manifesto. The government initially did try to play mischief by refusing to file affidavits in the Supreme Court and clarifying their position by saying that there is a need for ‘wider’ national discussion on the Article.But a few months later, the PDP-BJP government itself told the court that the permanent stature of Article 370 has been settled. The Supreme Court has indeed, in at least two instances, ruled that Article 370 has attained a permanent status in the Indian Constitution.So, the stumbling block for the Modi government to repeal and amend Article 370 will be a legal one.Article 368, which allows amendments to the Constitution, also does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir unless it is through an order of the President in accordance with Article 370. And, this requires the concurrence of the state government and ratification by the assembly.The conversation on revoking Article 370 will yield political mileage for 2019, but there’s little that the Modi government can do in reality.The Indian government has a constitutional duty to give Kashmir under Article 370 and some other states under Article 371 special treatment. An attempt to alter the provision strikes not just Kashmir but federalism because political sovereignty in India is shared between the union and its states.Compiled by Kritika Banerjee and Divya NarayananThePrint is now on Telegram. For the best reports & opinion on politics, governance and more, subscribe to ThePrint on Telegram.Article 370 exists in both, in GOI Constitution and in JK Assembly Constitution. Any correction or removal must take place signe and sealed by all stake holders. The teouble is the ones who hold JK Assembly powers are 3 to 5 families of long time Muslim heritage who will not make that change and the people of JK will go their representatives sides because they have not seen the fruits of GOI Constitution yet. GOI can not literally buy the JK people’s opinion unless they teach them, bribe them, put them in India with big rewards, and simply hope they will elect only those leaders in JK Assembly who will be proponents of any changes including removal of 370. It’s a catch 22. J. Nehru caused all this to happen. India can physically then, take full control of JK’s electoral process and for some reasons jail these families representatives, and replace them with those who will bring about these changes including removal. Another way is to attack JK and redraft / remove anything GOI does not like. That is called a Civil War.Like all things in life, nothing is permanent, not even the planets let alone the constitutions of India.  They are not set in stones and can never be permanent.  Constitutions are created to facilitate the working of a government and not to obstruct its efficiency.  They are not permanent and the Supreme Court’s opinion that Article 370 has attained a permanent status in the Indian constitution is itself restricted to time and the culture prevailing in a country. If the people of India demand a change in the constitution of India, only an authoritarian government will ignore the democratic will of its majority electorate.  India is a democratic country and it must be governed according to the wishes of its citizens. A nationwide referendum to gauge the views of the majority of Indians with regard to Article 370 will authenticate the true nature of Indian democracy. Any Indian piece of land whether it is in Andaman and Nicobar Islands or in Kashmir belong to all Indians, and not just or exclusively to their local inhabitants. All forms of privileges are unfair, discriminatory and misallocation of resources. Inequality of treatment whether in citizenship, economic opportunities or physical movement is backwardness and against fundamental human rights. The consequence of upholding Article 370 is itself anti-constitutional.Teh experts talk about the consequences, but a plain reading makes it clear that president can do it but not before seeking consent of constituent assembly of jk, which has been abolished in 1957. So first the constituent assembly is to be created to seek consent but that would be mean the abrogation of the accession signed by the then  constituent assembly, a legal herdl.Its abomination to read a senior journalist like Mr Jagannathan casually stating that historical events and facts don’t matter in governing of the nation.Its abomination again to read Mr Jagannathan informing the readers that Article 370 is there in the statute, just to appease “MUSLIMS”.Mr Jagannathan, dose the instrument of accession signed between the Union of India and the sovereign ruler, of J & K, by the way a “HINDU” betray the sentiments expressed by you in your piece?Apurva there was no ruling that happened with respect to Article 370. It was just a observation. So please do not give wrong information and claim you  are a journalist.Save my details",political,0

"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India. Pakistan's ambassador from India was recalled and the Indian ambassador to Pakistan was expelled.[134] The next day, Pakistan's Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad suspended the Samjhauta Express train service[135] and the Thar Express.[136] The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting decided to ban all cultural exchanges with India, including banning the screening of Indian films and dramas inside Pakistan.[137]Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in a press conference announced that Pakistan will remain committed to open the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikhs despite the tensions and said that ""We are ready to welcome our Sikh brothers and sisters for Baba Guru Nanak's 550th (birth) anniversary"".[138]On 9 August 2019, Pakistan formally suspended its trade relations with India and banned all exports and import to/from India.[139]On 11 August 2019, prime minister Imran Khan compared the Indian government to ""Nazis"", warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be same as ""appeasing Hitler"".[140][141][142] He accused that India was attempting to change the demography of the Muslim majority Kashmir through ethnic cleansing.[140][141][142] He questioned whether the world would watch and appease as they did for Hitler.[140][141][142]Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi issued a statement on Tuesday 13 August 2019 that he had written a letter to the president of the United Nations Security Council with a request to convene an emergency meeting of the council to discuss India's ""illegal actions that violate UN resolutions on Kashmir"".[143] The foreign minister also called for circulation of the letter among members of the Security Council.[143]On 20 August 2019, Pakistan announced that it will take the dispute to the International Court of Justice, adding that its case would centre on alleged human rights violations by India.[144]On 9 August, according to a Reuters report, over 10,000 people protested in Srinagar against Indian government's decision to revoke Article 370, with some protesters pelting stones at government security personnel.[226][227][228] In response, Indian police used tear gas and pellets against the protesters to disperse them.[64] According to Al Jazeera, it has been receiving information from Srinagar residents via satellite phones and Wi-Fi available in the Kashmir region. They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019. This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc
rding to India Today, in the Hindu majority Jammu region, people held widespread ""massive celebratory"" demonstrations over several days with the distribution of sweets, bursting of firecrackers and dancing.[235] In Ladakh, the Buddhist organizations celebrated the removal of Article 370 provisions and making the Ladakh region a separate Union Territory.[236] The people in Leh and Matho celebrated 15 August as a day of ""independence from Kashmir"" and welcomed their Union Territory status.[237]In the Kargil region with a Muslim majority, there were protests against the Indian government's move to make it a union territory.[238][239][240]A number of demonstrations and rallies have been organised in London, United Kingdom after India scrapped autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir. A large number of protesters demonstrated outside the Indian embassy in London on Saturday 10 August 2019 to express anger over Indian action.[241][242] There was another demonstration outside the Palace of Westminster on 14 August 2019.[243] A large protest took place outside the Indian High Commission in London on 15 August 2019, where Indians celebrating Indian Independence Day were attacked, and eggs, glass bottles, shoes and other objects were thrown at the High Commission and the people celebrating, by the anti-India protesters, who were mostly British Pakistanis and Sikh extremists.[244][245][246] The protest was allegedly backed by the Inter-Services Intelligence.[247] British PM Boris Johnson later expressed ""regret"" over this violent incident, and assured that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure the safety and security of the embassy, its personnel, and visitors.[248]
On Tuesday 3 September 2019, another violent protest took place outside the Indian High Commission in London, when pro-Pakistan protesters pelted stones and eggs at the embassy building, causing damage to the premises. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan condemned the incident, and tweeted ""I utterly condemn this unacceptable behaviour and have raised this incident with the Metropolitan police to take action.""[249][195] UK's metropolitan police made two arrests for causing criminal damage at the Indian High Commission following the incident.[250] British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the violence towards British Indians while addressing the parliament.[251]There were protest demonstrations outside the Indian consulate in Birmingham on 9 August 2019 to denounce the Indian revocation of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[252] Former member of the British parliament George Galloway was also part of the protest gathering and demanded a plebiscite in Kashmir.[252]A large number of protesters took to streets in Toronto, Canada on 11 August 2019 in support of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.[253] Demonstrators chanted protest slogans and carried placards.[253] The event description read ""Kashmiris do not accept the illegal occupation or unilateral colonial impositions by India.

Ghulam Nabi Fai, a Kashmiri diaspora alleged that the Indian plan is ""not only to deprive them [Kashmiris] of their rights but to subjugate them through widespread killings and torture"", while another protester originally hailing from Srinagar stressed that now was the time for the United States to mediate.[255]On 25 August 2019, according to the India Today, the Kashmiri Pandit community in the US held a rally supporting the decision, saying that Article 370 was ""discriminatory"" towards minorities in the Kashmir region.[256] At their rally, they told personal stories of their minority status in the Kashmir valley, the religious discrimination against them, their forced exodus in the 1990s, and they wanting to ""go back to their homeland [valley]"" which they left due to Islamic militancy.[256] At an Atlanta rally, the protestors alleged that the Article 370 was high discriminatory against the resident ""Shias, Dalits, Gujjars, Kashmiri Pandits, Kashmiri Sikhs"" in the state, according to India Today.[256]Many protest demonstrations have been reported in Bangladesh against the change of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[257][258][259] Pakistan's Abb Takk News channel reported that hundreds protested in Dhaka on 6 August 2019 against the Indian move.[257] Again on 7 August 2019, there was another demonstration in the city of Dhaka where the protesters criticized Narendra Modi and his scrapping of autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.[259] There was another demonstration on Thursday 8 August 2019 at the University of Dhaka by several Kashmiri students from different educational institutions.[258] There were more protests on 9 August 2019 after Friday prayers which were led by the Kashmir Solidarity Council Bangladesh.[260]On 12 August, 2019 Bahrain took punitive action against a group of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals who held a protest on the Kashmir decision the previous day. The protest was conducted after Eid al-Adha prayers in Bahrain illegally.[261] The official Twitter handle of the country's Interior Ministry tweeted about the action taken by the local police to contain the protests and also about the legal proceedings being taken against them. Bahrain authorities further requested its citizens to not exploit religious gatherings to further political motives.[262][263]Protests were held in Paris, France on 9 August 2019 to denounce Indian step of abrogation of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[264] The protesters alleged that India was conspiring to change the demography of Kashmir by expelling Kashmiris from their homes and bringing in Hindu settlers from other parts of India.[264]Pro-India and anti-India protesters faced off each other in Melbourne, Australia. Kashmiri Pandit groups welcomed India's decision, but the Pakistani community in Australia expressed ""deep concern"" regarding the situation in Kashmir. Indian groups in Australia said that this is something India has done internally and Pakistan has no right to interfere in India's internal matters.[265]Geo News reported that the Kashmiri diaspora gathered at the Pariser Platz of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and protested against India on 11 August 2019.[266]A group of protesters in Seoul, South Korea waving Pakistani flags and shouting anti-India slogans along with abuses for Indian PM Narendra Modi was confronted by an Indian delegation including Indian activist Shazia Ilmi. The Indian delegation started to counter the protesters, following which the local police intervened and escorted Shazia Ilmi and her associates from the location.[267]Several human rights activists and world leaders also commented on their social media accounts about the Kashmir situation. On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends.According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.[268][269][270][271] A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be ""current situation in Kashmir"".[269]According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an ""online misinformation war"".[272] The Nation, in its editorial said, ""The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.""[273]The Indian Home Ministry alleged that ""several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news"", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts.[274] Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors. The demand letter states that such rumors harm the law and order situation and is a ""threat to lives"".[274] They allege that the platform is posting ""objectionable and malicious"" content.[275] Twitter has blocked four of these accounts, and its officials stated that they are reviewing some others.[276] This included the twitter account of Syed Ali Shah Geelani who is a Kashmiri separatist Hurriyat leader.[277]India accused BBC and Reuters of lying and fabricating news about large scale protests in Kashmir even though they were recorded on video.[278] According to India Today, the authenticity of the BBC video about the protest has been questioned because it is an edited combination of a series of clips and it shows an absence of police and security personnel almost everywhere the edited video, even though Kashmir was under a lockdown with heavy security deployment on 9 August 2019 – the day the video was recorded and posted by BBC.[279] According to India Today, a portion of the video is authentically from Dullbagh Road in Srinagar, but it is unclear if it is a fresh video or an old video clip inserted in. Some Indians allege that parts of this video are from Pakistan-adminstered Kashmir.[279]",political,0
"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India.

They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019. This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc

Ghulam Nabi Fai, a Kashmiri diaspora alleged that the Indian plan is ""not only to deprive them [Kashmiris] of their rights but to subjugate them through widespread killings and torture"", while another protester originally hailing from Srinagar stressed that now was the time for the United States to mediate.[255]On 25 August 2019, according to the India Today, the Kashmiri Pandit community in the US held a rally supporting the decision, saying that Article 370 was ""discriminatory"" towards minorities in the Kashmir region.[256] At their rally, they told personal stories of their minority status in the Kashmir valley, the religious discrimination against them, their forced exodus in the 1990s, and they wanting to ""go back to their homeland [valley]"" which they left due to Islamic militancy.[256] At an Atlanta rally, the protestors alleged that the Article 370 was high discriminatory against the resident ""Shias, Dalits, Gujjars, Kashmiri Pandits, Kashmiri Sikhs"" in the state, according to India Today.[256]Many protest demonstrations have been reported in Bangladesh against the change of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[257][258][259] Pakistan's Abb Takk News channel reported that hundreds protested in Dhaka on 6 August 2019 against the Indian move.[257] Again on 7 August 2019, there was another demonstration in the city of Dhaka where the protesters criticized Narendra Modi and his scrapping of autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.[259] There was another demonstration on Thursday 8 August 2019 at the University of Dhaka by several Kashmiri students from different educational institutions.[258] There were more protests on 9 August 2019 after Friday prayers which were led by the Kashmir Solidarity Council Bangladesh.[260]On 12 August, 2019 Bahrain took punitive action against a group of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals who held a protest on the Kashmir decision the previous day.

"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India. Pakistan's ambassador from India was recalled and the Indian ambassador to Pakistan was expelled.[134] The next day, Pakistan's Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad suspended the Samjhauta Express train service[135] and the Thar Express.[136] The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting decided to ban all cultural exchanges with India, including banning the screening of Indian films and dramas inside Pakistan.[137]Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in a press conference announced that Pakistan will remain committed to open the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikhs despite the tensions and said that ""We are ready to welcome our Sikh brothers and sisters for Baba Guru Nanak's 550th (birth) anniversary"".[138]On 9 August 2019, Pakistan formally suspended its trade relations with India and banned all exports and import to/from India.[139]On 11 August 2019, prime minister Imran Khan compared the Indian government to ""Nazis"", warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be same as ""appeasing Hitler"".[140][141][142] He accused that India was attempting to change the demography of the Muslim majority Kashmir through ethnic cleansing.[140][141][142] He questioned whether the world would watch and appease as they did for Hitler.[140][141][142]Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi issued a statement on Tuesday 13 August 2019 that he had written a letter to the president of the United Nations Security Council with a request to convene an emergency meeting of the council to discuss India's ""illegal actions that violate UN resolutions on Kashmir"".[143] The foreign minister also called for circulation of the letter among members of the Security Council.[143]On 20 August 2019, Pakistan announced that it will take the dispute to the International Court of Justice, adding that its case would centre on alleged human rights violations by India.[144]On 9 August, according to a Reuters report, over 10,000 people protested in Srinagar against Indian government's decision to revoke Article 370, with some protesters pelting stones at government security personnel.[226][227][228] In response, Indian police used tear gas and pellets against the protesters to disperse them.[64] According to Al Jazeera, it has been receiving information from Srinagar residents via satellite phones and Wi-Fi available in the Kashmir region. They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019. This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc

On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends.According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.[268][269][270][271] A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be ""current situation in Kashmir"".[269]According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an ""online misinformation war"".[272] The Nation, in its editorial said, ""The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.""[273]The Indian Home Ministry alleged that ""several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news"", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts.[274] Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors.

Some Indians allege that parts of this video are from Pakistan-adminstered Kashmir.[279]",political,0
"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India. Pakistan's ambassador from India was recalled and the Indian ambassador to Pakistan was expelled.[134] The next day, Pakistan's Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad suspended the Samjhauta Express train service[135] and the Thar Express.[136] The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting decided to ban all cultural exchanges with India, including banning the screening of Indian films and dramas inside Pakistan.[137]Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi in a press conference announced that Pakistan will remain committed to open the Kartarpur Corridor for Sikhs despite the tensions and said that ""We are ready to welcome our Sikh brothers and sisters for Baba Guru Nanak's 550th (birth) anniversary"".[138]On 9 August 2019, Pakistan formally suspended its trade relations with India and banned all exports and import to/from India.[139]On 11 August 2019, prime minister Imran Khan compared the Indian government to ""Nazis"", warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be same as ""appeasing Hitler"".[140][141][142] He accused that India was attempting to change the demography of the Muslim majority Kashmir through ethnic cleansing.[140][141][142] He questioned whether the world would watch and appease as they did for Hitler.[140][141][142]Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi issued a statement on Tuesday 13 August 2019 that he had written a letter to the president of the United Nations Security Council with a request to convene an emergency meeting of the council to discuss India's ""illegal actions that violate UN resolutions on Kashmir"".[143] The foreign minister also called for circulation of the letter among members of the Security Council.[143]On 20 August 2019, Pakistan announced that it will take the dispute to the International Court of Justice, adding that its case would centre on alleged human rights violations by India.[144]On 9 August, according to a Reuters report, over 10,000 people protested in Srinagar against Indian government's decision to revoke Article 370, with some protesters pelting stones at government security personnel.[226][227][228] In response, Indian police used tear gas and pellets against the protesters to disperse them.[64] According to Al Jazeera, it has been receiving information from Srinagar residents via satellite phones and Wi-Fi available in the Kashmir region. They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019. This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc
rding to India Today, in the Hindu majority Jammu region, people held widespread ""massive celebratory"" demonstrations over several days with the distribution of sweets, bursting of firecrackers and dancing.[235] In Ladakh, the Buddhist organizations celebrated the removal of Article 370 provisions and making the Ladakh region a separate Union Territory.[236] The people in Leh and Matho celebrated 15 August as a day of ""independence from Kashmir"" and welcomed their Union Territory status.[237]In the Kargil region with a Muslim majority, there were protests against the Indian government's move to make it a union territory.[238][239][240]A number of demonstrations and rallies have been organised in London, United Kingdom after India scrapped autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir. A large number of protesters demonstrated outside the Indian embassy in London on Saturday 10 August 2019 to express anger over Indian action.[241][242] There was another demonstration outside the Palace of Westminster on 14 August 2019.[243] A large protest took place outside the Indian High Commission in London on 15 August 2019, where Indians celebrating Indian Independence Day were attacked, and eggs, glass bottles, shoes and other objects were thrown at the High Commission and the people celebrating, by the anti-India protesters, who were mostly British Pakistanis and Sikh extremists.[244][245][246] The protest was allegedly backed by the Inter-Services Intelligence.[247] British PM Boris Johnson later expressed ""regret"" over this violent incident, and assured that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure the safety and security of the embassy, its personnel, and visitors.[248]
On Tuesday 3 September 2019, another violent protest took place outside the Indian High Commission in London, when pro-Pakistan protesters pelted stones and eggs at the embassy building, causing damage to the premises.

Ghulam Nabi Fai, a Kashmiri diaspora alleged that the Indian plan is ""not only to deprive them [Kashmiris] of their rights but to subjugate them through widespread killings and torture"", while another protester originally hailing from Srinagar stressed that now was the time for the United States to mediate.[255]On 25 August 2019, according to the India Today, the Kashmiri Pandit community in the US held a rally supporting the decision, saying that Article 370 was ""discriminatory"" towards minorities in the Kashmir region.[256] At their rally, they told personal stories of their minority status in the Kashmir valley, the religious discrimination against them, their forced exodus in the 1990s, and they wanting to ""go back to their homeland [valley]"" which they left due to Islamic militancy.[256] At an Atlanta rally, the protestors alleged that the Article 370 was high discriminatory against the resident ""Shias, Dalits, Gujjars, Kashmiri Pandits, Kashmiri Sikhs"" in the state, according to India Today.[256]Many protest demonstrations have been reported in Bangladesh against the change of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[257][258][259] Pakistan's Abb Takk News channel reported that hundreds protested in Dhaka on 6 August 2019 against the Indian move.[257] Again on 7 August 2019, there was another demonstration in the city of Dhaka where the protesters criticized Narendra Modi and his scrapping of autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.[259] There was another demonstration on Thursday 8 August 2019 at the University of Dhaka by several Kashmiri students from different educational institutions.[258] There were more protests on 9 August 2019 after Friday prayers which were led by the Kashmir Solidarity Council Bangladesh.[260]On 12 August, 2019 Bahrain took punitive action against a group of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals who held a protest on the Kashmir decision the previous day. The protest was conducted after Eid al-Adha prayers in Bahrain illegally.[261] The official Twitter handle of the country's Interior Ministry tweeted about the action taken by the local police to contain the protests and also about the legal proceedings being taken against them. Bahrain authorities further requested its citizens to not exploit religious gatherings to further political motives.[262][263]Protests were held in Paris, France on 9 August 2019 to denounce Indian step of abrogation of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[264] The protesters alleged that India was conspiring to change the demography of Kashmir by expelling Kashmiris from their homes and bringing in Hindu settlers from other parts of India.[264]Pro-India and anti-India protesters faced off each other in Melbourne, Australia. Kashmiri Pandit groups welcomed India's decision, but the Pakistani community in Australia expressed ""deep concern"" regarding the situation in Kashmir. Indian groups in Australia said that this is something India has done internally and Pakistan has no right to interfere in India's internal matters.[265]Geo News reported that the Kashmiri diaspora gathered at the Pariser Platz of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and protested against India on 11 August 2019.[266]A group of protesters in Seoul, South Korea waving Pakistani flags and shouting anti-India slogans along with abuses for Indian PM Narendra Modi was confronted by an Indian delegation including Indian activist Shazia Ilmi. The Indian delegation started to counter the protesters, following which the local police intervened and escorted Shazia Ilmi and her associates from the location.[267]Several human rights activists and world leaders also commented on their social media accounts about the Kashmir situation. On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends.According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.[268][269][270][271] A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be ""current situation in Kashmir"".[269]According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an ""online misinformation war"".[272] The Nation, in its editorial said, ""The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.""[273]The Indian Home Ministry alleged that ""several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news"", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts.[274] Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors. The demand letter states that such rumors harm the law and order situation and is a ""threat to lives"".[274] They allege that the platform is posting ""objectionable and malicious"" content.[275] Twitter has blocked four of these accounts, and its officials stated that they are reviewing some others.[276] This included the twitter account of Syed Ali Shah Geelani who is a Kashmiri separatist Hurriyat leader.[277]India accused BBC and Reuters of lying and fabricating news about large scale protests in Kashmir even though they were recorded on video.[278] According to India Today, the authenticity of the BBC video about the protest has been questioned because it is an edited combination of a series of clips and it shows an absence of police and security personnel almost everywhere the edited video, even though Kashmir was under a lockdown with heavy security deployment on 9 August 2019 – the day the video was recorded and posted by BBC.[279] According to India Today, a portion of the video is authentically from Dullbagh Road in Srinagar, but it is unclear if it is a fresh video or an old video clip inserted in. Some Indians allege that parts of this video are from Pakistan-adminstered Kashmir.[279]",political,0
"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V.

During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India.

They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Army. Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians.[229]The Indian government called the Reuters report ""completely fabricated and incorrect"", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were ""a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people"".[230] The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports.[231]According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019.

Ghulam Nabi Fai, a Kashmiri diaspora alleged that the Indian plan is ""not only to deprive them [Kashmiris] of their rights but to subjugate them through widespread killings and torture"", while another protester originally hailing from Srinagar stressed that now was the time for the United States to mediate.[255]On 25 August 2019, according to the India Today, the Kashmiri Pandit community in the US held a rally supporting the decision, saying that Article 370 was ""discriminatory"" towards minorities in the Kashmir region.[256] At their rally, they told personal stories of their minority status in the Kashmir valley, the religious discrimination against them, their forced exodus in the 1990s, and they wanting to ""go back to their homeland [valley]"" which they left due to Islamic militancy.[256] At an Atlanta rally, the protestors alleged that the Article 370 was high discriminatory against the resident ""Shias, Dalits, Gujjars, Kashmiri Pandits, Kashmiri Sikhs"" in the state, according to India Today.[256]Many protest demonstrations have been reported in Bangladesh against the change of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir.[257][258][259] Pakistan's Abb Takk News channel reported that hundreds protested in Dhaka on 6 August 2019 against the Indian move.[257] Again on 7 August 2019, there was another demonstration in the city of Dhaka where the protesters criticized Narendra Modi and his scrapping of autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.[259] There was another demonstration on Thursday 8 August 2019 at the University of Dhaka by several Kashmiri students from different educational institutions.[258] There were more protests on 9 August 2019 after Friday prayers which were led by the Kashmir Solidarity Council Bangladesh.[260]On 12 August, 2019 Bahrain took punitive action against a group of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals who held a protest on the Kashmir decision the previous day.

Indian groups in Australia said that this is something India has done internally and Pakistan has no right to interfere in India's internal matters.[265]Geo News reported that the Kashmiri diaspora gathered at the Pariser Platz of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and protested against India on 11 August 2019.[266]A group of protesters in Seoul, South Korea waving Pakistani flags and shouting anti-India slogans along with abuses for Indian PM Narendra Modi was confronted by an Indian delegation including Indian activist Shazia Ilmi. The Indian delegation started to counter the protesters, following which the local police intervened and escorted Shazia Ilmi and her associates from the location.[267]Several human rights activists and world leaders also commented on their social media accounts about the Kashmir situation. On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends.According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.[268][269][270][271] A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be ""current situation in Kashmir"".[269]According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an ""online misinformation war"".[272] The Nation, in its editorial said, ""The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.""[273]The Indian Home Ministry alleged that ""several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news"", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts.[274] Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors. The demand letter states that such rumors harm the law and order situation and is a ""threat to lives"".[274] They allege that the platform is posting ""objectionable and malicious"" content.[275] Twitter has blocked four of these accounts, and its officials stated that they are reviewing some others.[276] This included the twitter account of Syed Ali Shah Geelani who is a Kashmiri separatist Hurriyat leader.[277]India accused BBC and Reuters of lying and fabricating news about large scale protests in Kashmir even though they were recorded on video.[278] According to India Today, the authenticity of the BBC video about the protest has been questioned because it is an edited combination of a series of clips and it shows an absence of police and security personnel almost everywhere the edited video, even though Kashmir was under a lockdown with heavy security deployment on 9 August 2019 – the day the video was recorded and posted by BBC.[279] According to India Today, a portion of the video is authentically from Dullbagh Road in Srinagar, but it is unclear if it is a fresh video or an old video clip inserted in. Some Indians allege that parts of this video are from Pakistan-adminstered Kashmir.[279]",political,0
"On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir—a region administered by India as a state, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and China since 1947.[1][2]Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation, all communication lines were cut in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency.[3] Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preventing violence and militancy,[4] and for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information.[5]International human rights groups condemned the revocation resolution.[6] The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication.[6][3] Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, who called the day the blackest in India's democracy.[6][3] Many Hindu nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir.[6] Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telegu Desam Party, and the Shiv Sena.  It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party,  Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK.[7][8] In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested;[9][10]  The Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision.[11][12]The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha – India's upper house of parliament – on 5 August 2019.[13] On 6 August, the Lok Sabha – India's lower house of parliament – debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.[14][15] The constitutional expert opinion is divided on whether the revocation is legally sound.[3]Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir—a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China.[1][2] The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state.[16][17] The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution.[18] This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states.[19]Under various Indian National Congress party-led central governments and locally elected state governments – such as those of the National Conference – between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of the Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute.[20][21][22] According to Sumantra Bose, a political science scholar known for his Kashmir studies, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began ""the end for the Article 370"" and it has ""effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time"".[23]Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India.[24] As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[25][26] On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.[27][28] Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.[citation needed]Article 370 of the Constitution of India is a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution.[29] Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed ""consultation"" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed ""concurrence"" of the state government.[30] Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state.[29]In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist.[31] To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution.[29] On 5 August, a presidential order was issued – the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 – which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.[32]After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly.[33][34] Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had ""no Kashmir government at all"", states Jill Cottrell.[35] The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.[36]The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the ""concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir"". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state.[17][note 1] The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so.[29] To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'.[39][40] Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir.[39][29] The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.[29]Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative.[29] Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it.[13] On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against.[14][15]On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same.[41][42]The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India.[42] Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region.[43]The supreme court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories will come into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.[44]Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area.[45] On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are ""planning to upscale violence"" and tried to ""target the Yatra recently.""[45] The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir.[46] These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status.[46] However on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik ""assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.""[45]On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces.[45] The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet.[47] Many news sources reported an effective curfew[48][49] (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew[48]). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby.[50]Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region.[51][52][53] The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where ""people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence"", according to The Guardian newspaper.[54][55] Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters.[48] Shops and clinics were closed,[47] as were all educational institutions[50] and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir.[45] The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019.[52]Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not.[56] Journalist were not issued curfew passes.[48] The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli – a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest.[57] Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives.[58] A local journalist told CPJ that ""I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening"".[59][60] CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir.[61]In addition to local Kashmir journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams haven't been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar capital. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, ""her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite-linked outside broadcasting vans"", according to Reuters.[56] The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as ""conformist"" and alleged to ""look like they are afraid of the government"" by H. K. Dua – a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers.[56]More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence.[62][63] This figure was about 500 by 9 August.[64][65] Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah,[66] and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under ""preventive detention""[66] by the security forces.[45]India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016.[4] He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout.[67]On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam – the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley.[68] According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019.[69] Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019.[68] Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019.[69] However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all.[70][71] According to Subrahmanyam, ""12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any
side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations"".[68][72]As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley.[73] On 14 October 2019, mobile phone services were fully restored in the region.[74]The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the ""blackest day of Indian democracy"". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired.[6][80]Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 ""unilateral and shocking"". He deemed it a ""total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947"".[81]Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of ""religion, language or region"" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting ""without the consent from the people"" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district.[82]Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that ""This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,"" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was ""an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.""[83][84][85] Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders.[86]The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added ""Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370—and the Congress party is responsible for that"".[87] Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil.[88][89]The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association[90] who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders.[91] The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny.[11][12]It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums.[92][93][94]Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced[95] from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence[96][97] welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people[98] will be able to return.[99]The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status.[100][101] Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation.[102]The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in ""haste"" and the revocation is an ""arbitrary misuse of state power"".[103][note 2] The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was ""utterly and palpably unconstitutional"",[104] even fraudulent. It is headed for a ""showdown in India's Supreme Court"".[6]Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was ""not proud as an Indian"".[105] He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as ""a classical colonial excuse"" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people.[106]Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times.[107]The leaders of the Indian National Congress – India's main opposition party – was divided on the revocation of Article 370.[108][109] Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah.[110] Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation.[111] Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as ""totally unconstitutional"" and said ""this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.""[112] The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab.[113]Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions ""unconstitutional & undemocratic.""[114]Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a ""death of Indian democracy"". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move ""an assault on Indian constitution"".[115] The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as ""murder of democracy"", while O'Brien called it a ""procedural harakiri"".[8]The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing.[116] One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders.[117][118] The Supreme Court rejected the ""urgent hearing"" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings.[116]The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes.[5]The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an ""overwhelming majority"" of support in the Indian parliament.[6] It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP.[119][8]Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has ""lost its way"".[120] Deputy Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, ""I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.""[121] Similarly, the Congress party's whip in the parliament, Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir ""is in the interest of national integrity"".[121] Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, ""The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.""[122] Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a ""historical mistake"" had been corrected.[121]The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370.[119] Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people – including the Buddhists – will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, ""the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy"".[123][124]The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a ""courageous and daring"" step by Amit Shah.[125] Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, ""I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country"" and welcomed the move.[126] The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status.[8]Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people.[127][128]Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society.[129]Immediately after India revoked Article 370 of its constitution that gives special rights to the Kashmir, the Foreign Office issued a statement stating, ""As a party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps."" It called the revocation a ""unilateral step"" and said it violated the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.[130]After a meeting of the army commanders on 6 August 2019, Pakistan's army chief said that Pakistan Army stood by the Kashmiris in their just struggle to the very end and that the army would ""go to any extent"" to support the people of Kashmir.[131]President of Pakistan Arif Alvi summoned an emergency joint parliamentary sitting of the National Assembly and the Senate to discuss the situation.[132] On 7 August, the joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move and called it ""illegal, unilateral, reckless and coercive attempt to alter the disputed status of Indian occupied Kashmir as enshrined in the UNSC resolutions"".[133]On 7 August, a meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India.

This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the ""protest never took place"".[232] On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, ""between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials"", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump-action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.[233] According to Reuters, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on 11 August, after authorities had eased restrictions in the city over the weekend to allow people to buy groceries, medicines and prepare for the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha.[234]Acc

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Narendra Modi government on Monday moved to dramatically alter the status quo in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government ended days of speculation by making public its decision to effectively revoke the controversial Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.Article 370 accords special status to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag and rights. On Monday morning, home minister Amit Shah rose in Rajya Sabha to announce that the government was moving a Presidential order for Parliament's ratification.The Presidential order used a clause of Article 370 to say that provisions of Article 370 would no longer be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir, a move that essentially revokes the article without actually doing so.In a follow-up, but equally bold move, Amit Shah also said the government was moving a bill to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories -- Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. While the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir would have a legislature, a la Delhi, Ladakh would not.The Narendra Modi government's historic decision on Jammu and Kashmir, which ranks among the most unprecedented political moves in the country, will be debated for days, even weeks to come. Here is everything you need to know about what happened on Monday.What did the government do today?The government today moved a resolution to effectively abolish Article 370, which gives special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government also introduced a Bill to divide the state into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh.So Jammu and Kashmir is no longer a state?Short answer: Not yet. The Rajya Sabha has passed the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill which bifurcates the state into two Union territories. The Lok Sabha (where the BJP has a brute majority) now must pass the Bill, which will then go to the President for his assent. Once the President signs the Bill and the government issues a notification, Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be a state.READ | Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh: This is how the redrawn map will look likeBasically:And, what about Article 370? Has it been scrapped?Technically: No. As of now, the government has used a clause within Article 370 to make the provisions of the article inoperative.Let us explain.READ | How govt used Article 370 to kill Article 370What even is Article 370?Article 370 is an enabling provision. It explains which parts of the Indian Constitution have jurisdiction over Jammu and Kashmir, which adopted a separate state constitution for itself during the 1950s.According to it, the Central government needs the concurrence of J&K state government for applying laws. Now that changes.READ | Article 370 has not been scrapped. What does Modi govt move on Kashmir mean?So what happens to Article 35A?Article 35A, making a distinction between the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir and the outsiders, will also cease to have any effect in Jammu and Kashmir.Why did the government move to revoke the powers of Article 370?Revoking Article 370 of the Constitution has been a key part of the BJP's core agenda and has always struck an emotional chord with its rank and file after its ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee died in a Jammu and Kashmir jail in 1953 to protest the state's special status and demand its complete integration with the Union.Apart from ideology, the Modi government:Has anybody supported the Modi government on its Article 370 move?Yes, apart from NDA allies Shiv Sena, RPI, Akali Dal and others, regional parties like BSP, AAP, BJD, TRS and AIADMK extended full support to the resolution to effectively scrap Article 370 and the Bill to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir. You can read all about that here.How has the Valley reacted to these developments?Since communication in the Valley is currently snapped, there are no first-person reports from the ground.The situation in Kashmir Valley appeared to be ""under control"" as no untoward incident was reported on Monday.However, this can be attributed to the fact authorities have imposed curfew in Kishtwar and Rajouri districts and in the Banihal area of Ramban district, while restrictions were imposed in many districts of Jammu division and Srinagar.NOTE: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, who were under house arrest since Sunday night, have been arrested. Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference leaders Sajjad Lone and Imran Ansari have also been arrested.What is the Opposition saying on these developments related to Jammu and Kashmir?Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement evoked strong protests from the opposition with leaders of Congress, TMC, DMK, NCP and Left raising slogans and storming the well of the House.Some opposition parties termed the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two union territories as a ""black spot"". While Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad Monday said that the state's head, considered as India's crown, has been ""chopped off"" and its identity removed, TMC MP Derek O'Brien said that the Centre was committing ""procedural harakiri"".READ | Today we lost Kashmir: Kapil Sibal accuses govt of evading debate on Article 370Why were all eyes on Amit Shah today?READ | J&K to become state again when the time is right, says Amit ShahSo, what's next for Jammu and Kashmir?As India aims for $5 trillion economy, direct tax data show wealth concentrated in 3 statesWhat's brewing up in Congress with Sonia back as party chief, dissenters growing?Riots in India are decreasing but becoming more intense: NCRB dataIs ED heat on Opposition a witch-hunt?

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe biggest decision of the Narendra Modi government came shortly after 50 days of the beginning of its second term. The government on Monday moved Parliament to remove the special status provision to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, revoking 1954 Presidential proclamation through a gazette notification.With that revocation order, Article 35A no longer exists. The article defined the permanent resident of Jammu and Kashmir and also defined the state's relationship with the Centre, and barred non-permanent residents from permanently settling in J&K. It also gives rights of buying immovable property, acquiring land, applying for government jobs, any kind of scholarships and aids, and other public welfare projects to state domicile.Once the President revokes the order, the special status of the status will be withdrawn. This paves way for what the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long believed - Ek Nishan, Ek Vidhan aur Ek Pradhan (One flag, one Constitution and one leader).Here are some of the significant changes in Jammu and Kashmir:1. J&K Constitution scrappedBefore Article 370 - It was the only state with its own Constitution. The article provided J&K provisions of the Constitution which were not applicable to other states of the country including special autonomy, separate state laws, etc.After Article 370 - With the scrapping provisions of Article 370, the separate Constitution ceases to exist.2. Separate flagBefore Article 370 - The J&K state had two different flags - India and the state.After Article 370 - There would be no separate flag for the state.(Sources, however, said that a decision could be taken on it as Karnataka, too, has proposed its own flag)3. Any Indian can now buy properties in J&KBefore Article 370 - Only residents of J&K could buy and sell properties in the state.After Article 370 - Any Indian citizen will be able to buy and sell properties in J&K.4. CRPC in, RPC outBefore Article 370 - Residents of J&K had separate laws related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights.After Article 370 - There will be no separate laws for the citizens of J&K. Crpc will be in, Ranbir Penal Code of the state will be out.5. The state becomes a Union TerritoryBefore Article 370 - Jammu and Kashmir was a state with special status.After Article 370 - J&K downsized to a Union Territory (UT) with legislature while Ladakh becomes the UT without any legislature.Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Women, Dalits, tribals and minorities of Jammu and Kashmir are now equal citizens of IndiaSince 5 August, when the government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), the floodgates of righteous rage from the usual suspects from India and the rest of the world have opened. Hardly surprising. This was the jackboot, the blood-soaked end of democracy, a rape of the Constitution, the trampling of fundamental rights of Kashmiris, and so on. These hyperventilating flag-bearers of freedom (or whatever) should calm down and consider one historical fact. Which is this. The “temporary and transitional"" provision Article 370 made an exception to the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Indian Constitution. These fundamental rights have now been restored. And this is shockingly easy to explain.A New York Times columnist has wailed that the government has now converted “the people of Kashmir to second-class citizens, if not subjects"". Sorry, but the truth is that some of these people—specifically the male Kashmiri Muslim—enjoyed far greater rights than any other Indian citizen; they have now been brought down to equal status. And many other inhabitants of the erstwhile state had fewer rights than normal Indian citizens; they have been granted equality. One would think that anyone who believed in democracy would see that as a good thing.To explain this, we must come to “majoritarianism"", over which much chest-beating is going on. Some people have seen the government’s action as “unabashed majoritarianism"". Whereas, if there ever was any unabashed and constitutionally sanctioned majoritarianism anywhere in India, it was in J&K through Article 370. The Constitution of this Muslim-majority state did not have the word “minorities"" anywhere in it. Unlike in the Indian Constitution, their rights were not protected. J&K was also the only Indian state with no tribal rights (and the state had no right to education either). And it should be our national shame that we allow these hypocrites to freely talk of majoritarianism while staying silent about the 20th century’s swiftest forced exodus of a minority community—Hindu Pandits from Kashmir in 1990.There is extensive scare-mongering that the removal of Article 35A will lead to land grab by non-Kashmiris, because the law permitted ownership of immovable property in the state only by permanent residents (PRs). But this law also stipulated that J&K women who married non-PRs, lost their PR status and inheritance rights. When we spoke to an old family friend, a Kashmiri lady engineer married to a non-Kashmiri, who played a key role in the Chandrayaan-2 launch, she was tearful; all she could think of was building a little home in her homeland. Article 35A also ensured that the thousands of descendants of Valmikis (Dalits) who were brought in from Punjab as government sweepers in 1957 were never allowed to get any government jobs other than sweepers. And they could not even get a Scheduled Caste certificate from the state government, so were not eligible for any benefits under central schemes. Hindu and Sikh refugees from West Pakistan remained non-PR second-class citizens, while Uighur Muslims from Xinjiang were granted PR status. And we are supposed to believe that Kashmiri Muslims have become second-class citizens, when in reality, actual second-class citizens now have full citizen rights.Majoritarianism? Watch the video of Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal’s Lok Sabha speech on 6 August to know what majoritarian oppression means to a religious and ethnic minority. Fear is being spread about the government plotting demographic change in Kashmir, like China settling Han Chinese in Tibet. But systematic attempts to change demography have been in progress for years in J&K, through settling Muslims in Buddhist-majority Ladakh (Namgyal mentioned this), and recently, Rohingyas in Jammu.The vast majority of Indians have never understood why J&K deserved special status, and certainly Sardar Patel and B.R. Ambedkar were vehemently opposed to Article 370. Patel told his secretary, V. Shankar: “Jawaharlal royega (Jawaharlal will weep over this)"", and Ambedkar refused to attend the session that passed the motion. And the fact that many Opposition parties supported the revocation, that even Congress is divided over it, obviously indicates that politicians know that the people of our democratic republic feel that it’s time for all Indians to be equal citizens.The real test begins now. With J&K a Union territory, the central government must ensure that funds are deployed properly and don’t line the pockets of a few families and their cronies. However, it will take time before industry feels that the valley is a safe bet. Pakistan will try to up its terrorist game. Also, when the US withdraws its troops from Afghanistan, some of the Taliban’s resources will be available to Pakistan to be re-directed towards Kashmir. But, most importantly, the doubting Kashmiri Muslim must realize that Article 370 made him special in a very negative way. It kept him alienated from his nation for seven decades. No Malayali, Gujarati, Assamese, and no Dogra or Ladakhi has lost his identity because he is an Indian. India has opened her arms. It is now up to sceptical Kashmiris to accept the offer.Sandipan Deb is a former editor of ‘Financial Express’, and founder-editor of ‘Open’ and ‘Swarajya’ magazinesLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIndia's BJP-led government is hailing its decision to strip the state of Jammu and Kashmir of autonomy after seven decades, characterising it as the correction of a ""historical blunder"". The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi explains why this has happened and why it's important.Kashmir is a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan say is fully theirs.The area was once a princely state called Jammu and Kashmir, but it joined India in 1947 soon after the sub-continent was divided up at the end of British rule.India and Pakistan subsequently went to war over it and each came to control different parts of the territory with a ceasefire line agreed.There has been violence in the Indian-administered side - the state of Jammu and Kashmir - for 30 years due to a separatist insurgency against Indian rule.In the first few days of August, there were signs of something afoot in Kashmir.Tens of thousands of additional Indian troops were deployed, a major Hindu pilgrimage was cancelled, schools and colleges were shut, tourists were ordered to leave, telephone and internet services were suspended and regional political leaders were placed under house arrest.But most of the speculation was that Article 35A of the Indian constitution, which gave some special privileges to the people of the state, would be scrapped.The government then stunned everyone by saying it was revoking nearly all of Article 370, which 35A is part of and which has been the basis of Kashmir's complex relationship with India for some 70 years.The article allowed the state a certain amount of autonomy - its own constitution, a separate flag and freedom to make laws. Foreign affairs, defence and communications remained the preserve of the central government.As a result, Jammu and Kashmir could make its own rules relating to permanent residency, ownership of property and fundamental rights. It could also bar Indians from outside the state from purchasing property or settling there.The constitutional provision has underpinned India's often fraught relationship with Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority region to join India at partition.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party had long opposed Article 370 and revoking it was in the party's 2019 election manifesto.They argued it needed to be scrapped to integrate Kashmir and put it on the same footing as the rest of India. After returning to power with a massive mandate in the April-May general elections, the government lost no time in acting on its pledge.Critics of Monday's move are linking it to the economic slowdown that India is currently facing - they say it provides a much-needed diversion for the government.Many Kashmiris believe that the BJP ultimately wants to change the demographic character of the Muslim-majority region by allowing non-Kashmiris to buy land there.Although Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement in parliament on Monday came as a surprise to most Indians, it would have taken the government some preparation to arrive at the decision.The move also fits in with Mr Modi's desire to show that the BJP is tough on Kashmir, and Pakistan.Kashmir will no longer have a separate constitution but will have to abide by the Indian constitution much like any other state.All Indian laws will be automatically applicable to Kashmiris, and people from outside the state will be able to buy property there.The government says this will bring development to the region.""I want to tell the people of Jammu and Kashmir what damage Articles 370 and 35A did to the state,"" Mr Shah told parliament. ""It's because of these sections that democracy was never fully implemented, corruption increased in the state, that no development could take place.""The government is also moving to break up the state into two smaller, federally administered territories. One region will combine Muslim-majority Kashmir and Hindu-majority Jammu. The other is Buddhist-majority Ladakh, which is culturally and historically close to Tibet.P Chidambaram, a senior leader in the opposition Congress Party described the decision as a ""catastrophic step"" and warned in parliament that it could have serious consequences.""You may think you have scored a victory, but you are wrong and history will prove you to be wrong. Future generations will realise what a grave mistake this house is making today,"" he said.According to the constitution, Article 370 could only be modified with the agreement of the ""state government"". But there hasn't been much of a state government in Jammu and Kashmir for over a year now.In June last year, India imposed federal rule after the government of the then chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, was reduced to a minority. This meant the federal government only had to seek the consent of the governor who imposes its rule.The government says it is well within its rights to bring in the changes and that similar decisions have been taken by federal governments in the past.But expert opinion is sharply divided.One constitutional expert, Subhash Kashyap, told news agency ANI that the order was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".However another constitutional expert, AG Noorani, told BBC Hindi it was ""an illegal decision, akin to committing fraud"" that could be challenged in the Supreme Court.Opposition political parties could launch a legal challenge but Kashmir is an emotive issue with many Indians, and most parties would be wary of opposing the move lest they be branded anti-India.That could leave any challenge up to individuals or activists.Lt Col Alexander Vindman listened to the phone call that sparked the impeachment inquiry against the US president.Have you been getting these songs wrong?What happens to your body in extreme heat?",political,0

							  Last Updated at August 5, 2019 07:31 ISThttps://mybs.in/2X7hPhkRumours are afloat that the Modi-led government is set to scrap Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution. The rumours were triggered by reports of Centre deploying additional paramilitary troops to address the likely fallout from the removal of the controversial Article 35A in J&K. The government has, however, said that these are precautionary measures in view of terrorist threats. Meanwhile, various political leaders including former Chief Ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti have been placed under house arrest. Mobile internet services have also been barred.

		The rumours reflect apprehensions in the Valley following Home Minister Amit Shah’s pointed statement in Parliament that Article 370, which deals with the special status of J&K, was “temporary in nature” and “not permanent”. While Jammu wants the provision to be scrapped from the Constitution, Kashmir valley-centric parties, across the board, warn that tampering with the special provision would stir the hornets' nest and the fallout would be difficult to handle.document.write(""<!--"");if(isUserBanner==""free""&&(displayConBanner==1))document.write(""-->"");googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/6516239/outofpage_1x1_desktop','div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0').addService(googletag.pubads());googletag.pubads().enableSyncRendering();googletag.enableServices();});

What are Article 370 and 35A? Are they amendable? If abrogated can it solve the long standing political dispute in Jammu and Kashmir?

Here's an explainer on Article 35A and 370

Article 370 grants an autonomous status to J&K, while Article 35A, incorporated into the Constitution in 1954, provides special rights and privileges to the citizens of the state.

What the two articles mean:

Article 370

History

		In October 1947, the then-Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir signed the ‘Instrument of Accession’, which specified three subjects on which Jammu and Kashmir would transfer its powers to the government of India: 1. Foreign affairs, 2. Defence and 3. Communications. In March 1948, the Maharaja appointed an interim government in the state, with Sheikh Abdullah as the prime minister. In July 1949, Sheikh Abdullah and three other colleagues joined the Indian Constituent Assembly and negotiated the special status of J&K, leading to the adoption of Article 370. The controversial provision was drafted by Sheikh Abdullah.

What are the provisions of Article 370?

		Parliament needs the Jammu & Kashmir government's nod for applying laws in the state — except defence, foreign affairs, finance, and communications.

		The law of citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights of the residents of Jammu & Kashmir is different from the residents living in rest of India. Under Article 370, citizens from other states cannot buy property in Jammu & Kashmir. Under Article 370, the Centre has no power to declare financial emergency.

		It is important to note Article 370(1)(c) explicitly mentions that Article 1 of the Indian Constitution applies to Kashmir through Article 370. Article 1 lists the states of the Union. This means that it is Article 370 that binds the state of J&K to the Indian Union. Removing Article 370, which can be done by a Presidential Order, would therefore make the state independent of India.

Temporary provision or not?

		A petition filed by Kumari Vijayalakshmi Jha challenged the validity of Article 370 against the Delhi High Court's April 11, 2017 order. The petition had said that the continuance of the temporary provision of Article 370 even after dissolution of Constituent Assembly of J&K, and that of J&K Constitution, which has never got the assent of the President of India or Parliament or the government of India, ""amounts to fraud on the basic structure of our Constitution"".

Article 35A

What is it?

		Article 35A gives the Jammu & Kashmir Legislature full discretionary power to decide who the 'permanent residents' of the state are. It gives them special rights and privileges regarding employment with the state government, acquisition of property in the state, settling in the state, and the right to scholarships and other forms of aid that the state government provides. It also allows the state legislature to impose any restrictions upon persons other than the permanent residents regarding the above.

		To guarantee these special rights and privileges, the Article says no act of the state legislature that comes under it can be challenged for violating the Constitution or any other laws.

What will happen if Article 35A is repealed?

		Repealment of Article 35A by the Supreme Court of India or by the government will have some far-reaching implications. Before Article 35A was introduced to the Constitution of India, the Governor and the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir were addressed as the Sadr-e-Riyasat (President) and Wazir-e-Azam (Prime Minister). There's a possibility that if Article 35A is repealed, it would lead J&K back to the same arrangement.

		The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of India would also be curtailed. The legal control of the Centre over Jammu and Kashmir would be limited only to the matters of Defence, External Affairs and Communication.

Which parties are against the removal of Articles 35A and 370

		All Kashmir valley based parties, including the National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (J&KPM) and others are opposed to any tinkering with Articles 35A and 370 that give a special status to J&K. The Congress party also wants these articles to be protected. Congress leaders maintain that senior leaders of the party, including late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had painstakingly worked out J&K's relationship with India through promises made in these articles. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has warned the Centre against the revocation of Article 35A, saying any tinkering with the constitutional provision would be akin to setting a powder keg on fire. Mufti asked her party workers to get ready for a big fight for the protection of Article 35A, which gives special rights and privileges to the state's permanent residents.

		""We want to tell the central government that tinkering with Article 35A will be akin to setting a powder keg on fire,"" the PDP president said. ""If any hand tries to touch Article 35A, not only that hand, but that whole body will be burnt to ashes.""

		Mufti said they would fight till death any attempt to tinker with the state's special status.

Who wants Articles 35A and 370 removed?

		Among the centrist mainstream parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands for abrogation of these articles arguing they are roadblocks not only to the integration of the state with the rest of the country but also in the development of J&K.Rumours are afloat that the Modi-led government is set to scrap Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution.

The petition had said that the continuance of the temporary provision of Article 370 even after dissolution of Constituent Assembly of J&K, and that of J&K Constitution, which has never got the assent of the President of India or Parliament or the government of India, ""amounts to fraud on the basic structure of our Constitution"".Article 35AWhat is it?Article 35A gives the Jammu & Kashmir Legislature full discretionary power to decide who the 'permanent residents' of the state are. It gives them special rights and privileges regarding employment with the state government, acquisition of property in the state, settling in the state, and the right to scholarships and other forms of aid that the state government provides. It also allows the state legislature to impose any restrictions upon persons other than the permanent residents regarding the above.To guarantee these special rights and privileges, the Article says no act of the state legislature that comes under it can be challenged for violating the Constitution or any other laws.What will happen if Article 35A is repealed?Repealment of Article 35A by the Supreme Court of India or by the government will have some far-reaching implications. Before Article 35A was introduced to the Constitution of India, the Governor and the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir were addressed as the Sadr-e-Riyasat (President) and Wazir-e-Azam (Prime Minister). There's a possibility that if Article 35A is repealed, it would lead J&K back to the same arrangement.The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of India would also be curtailed. The legal control of the Centre over Jammu and Kashmir would be limited only to the matters of Defence, External Affairs and Communication.Which parties are against the removal of Articles 35A and 370All Kashmir valley based parties, including the National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (J&KPM) and others are opposed to any tinkering with Articles 35A and 370 that give a special status to J&K. The Congress party also wants these articles to be protected. Congress leaders maintain that senior leaders of the party, including late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had painstakingly worked out J&K's relationship with India through promises made in these articles. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has warned the Centre against the revocation of Article 35A, saying any tinkering with the constitutional provision would be akin to setting a powder keg on fire. Mufti asked her party workers to get ready for a big fight for the protection of Article 35A, which gives special rights and privileges to the state's permanent residents.""We want to tell the central government that tinkering with Article 35A will be akin to setting a powder keg on fire,"" the PDP president said. ""If any hand tries to touch Article 35A, not only that hand, but that whole body will be burnt to ashes.""Mufti said they would fight till death any attempt to tinker with the state's special status.Who wants Articles 35A and 370 removed?Among the centrist mainstream parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands for abrogation of these articles arguing they are roadblocks not only to the integration of the state with the rest of the country but also in the development of J&K.PREVIOUS STORYNEXT STORYCopyrights © 2019 Business Standard Private Ltd.

"Keep Me Logged InThe Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) is in lockdown after the government revoked a special status granted to the troubled region.On Monday, Interior Minister Amit Shah told India's parliament that the central government would scrap Article 370, a constitutional provision that grants special status and allows the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir to make its own laws. The order was subsequently approved by the Indian President.CNBC takes a look at what this means for Kashmir and for the Muslim-majority state's relationship with India.Article 370 of the Indian constitution carves out a special status to the state of J&K. It also limits the Indian parliament's power to make laws for the state. In effect, the special status, which is described as ""temporary"" allows the state of Jammu & Kashmir to have its own constitution, its own flag and take decisions except for any matter that is related to defense and foreign affairs. The temporary provision was included in the constitution on 17 October, 1949.This special status dates back to the end of British rule in India in 1947 when Maharaja Hari Singh of the then colonized state of Jammu & Kashmir signed a Treaty of Accession for the state of J&K to join the Indian side.Meanwhile, Article 35a, which was added to the constitution in 1954 under Article 370 gives the state of Jammu & Kashmir the right to decide who its permanent residents are. The clause further gives special rights to residents in government jobs, when buying property in the state and for educational scholarships among others.The state defines its permanent residents as those that are ""born or settled within the state before 1911 or after having lawfully acquired immovable property and resident in the state for not less than 10 years before that date.""The law bans non-permanent residents from settling in the state, buying land, and taking government jobs or scholarships.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party had pushed for an end to Kashmir's special constitutional status, arguing that such laws had hindered its integration with the rest of India.India's government wants to strengthen its influence over its only Muslim-majority region.In the run up to the most recent elections in May this year, Modi's Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) had promised a firm policy action to bring peace in the Jammu & Kashmir region.""In the last five years, we have made all necessary efforts to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir through decisive actions and a firm policy. We are committed to overcoming all obstacles that come in the way of development and providing adequate financial resources to all the regions of the state. We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Article 370,"" according to the manifesto.On Monday, Interior Minister Amit Shah introduced the measure in parliament amid massive protests from the opposition as well as regional parties in J&K. Opposition parties have condemned the government's proposal, calling it ""undemocratic.""Shah also said the state will be divided into two union territories – Jammu & Kashmir, which will have its own legislature, and Ladakh, which will be ruled directly by the central government and will have no legislature of its own. A union territory is a type of administrative division in India. Unlike the states of India, which have their own governments, union territories are federal territories governed directly by the main government.India has deployed tens of thousands of troops across the Kashmir valley in anticipation of a backlash of the revoke.Indian authorities banned public movements, shut down schools and colleges indefinitely and put two former chief ministers of J&K — Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti — under house arrest ahead of the announcement.The two leaders took to Twitter to express their disappointment over the decision and warned of consequences.Indian media reports suggest that mobile internet services have been suspended in Kashmir Valley and Satellite phones were being used by security officials.Critics on Twitter have condemned the move, calling it ""authoritarianism."" Indian-author Ramachandra Guha blamed the government for taking action without a proper debate.On Monday, the Pakistan government strongly condemned India for taking ""illegal steps"" in its decision to revoke special status for Kashmir. This according to Reuters, citing a government statement.The Pakistan government also warned that it will ""exercise all possible options.""""As the party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps,"" Pakistan's foreign ministry said in a statement.India and Pakistan's conflict over the mountainous region of Kashmir dates back to 1947 when both countries became independent from British colonial rule.The entire subcontinent was partitioned into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan, which led to a mass displacement as people migrated from one country to the other. Outbreaks of communal and religious violence killed hundreds of thousands of people in the subcontinent during that time.Jammu and Kashmir was a former princely state where a large number of people were killed and others were driven away by the violence during the partition. Since then, India and Pakistan have fought multiple wars over the region — both countries claim the region in full but control only parts of it. Many have raised concerns over violence and human rights abuses in both India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, as well as in Pakistan-controlled Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan region.— CNBC's John Schoen contributed to this report.Got a confidential news tip?

"Holding placards against the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370, the two MPs urged the government to ""respect"" the special status of the region.The national capital witnessed a dip in pollution levels on November 16 morning even as the air quality in the city remained in the ""severe"" category.The trial runs, through the restive south Kashmir, were done after a thorough safety audit of the section, a railway official told PTI.Attributing the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to Modi's political will and Amit Shah's strategy, Nadda said by uprooting a ""70-year-old cancer"" within a month of coming to power for a second term, the prime minister has shown how a strong government works.BJP working president JP Nadda asked party functionaries to expose the ""blatant lie"" of Congress leaders which has hurt the country's image abroad, by raising questions on the transparency of defence deals in India.A 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice N V Ramana said that passing any interim order might lead to delay in the matter and the apex court would settle all the issues at one go after hearing all the parties.Article 35A became history on August 5 as a consequence of the Centre's decision to abrogate the provisions of Article 370 which had given special status to the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir.Addressing a press conference here, Congress spokesman Pawan Kheda said, ""Not once or twice, but the Congress party diluted article 370 as many as 12 times, but without letting any controversy break out.""Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday transitioned from a state into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, nearly three months after the NDA government abrogated the state's special status.The stick has been used to good effect, it’s now time to use the carrot .While bureaucratic structures are in place, the staff of the state administration is yet to be dividedReal estate experts feel it is still too early to gauge the real impact on Kashmir's real estate market. As of now, it is still a highly sensitive region and security concerns may keep property buyers at bay.The 59-year-old, who happens to be one of the youngest governors the country has had, has been a trusted aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi since the time he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.Reacting sharply to India's move to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to bring it in line with the rest of the country, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian envoy.India and Saudi Arabia are re-defining their foreign policy priorities: For New Delhi, Saudi Arabia and the Arab Gulf states are becoming key interlocutors in the Middle East. For Riyadh, India is one of the eight major powers with which it wants to forge strategic partnerships as part of its Vision 2030.The two UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh come into existence on Thursday after the central government on August 5 decided to abrogate the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and create them on October 31.Shah also said Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's unfullfilled dream of integrating Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country was accomplished on August 5 when Article 370 and 35A were repealed.The total number of states in India is now 28, while the total UTs will has gone up to nine""The CPI(M) reiterates its strong opposition to the abrogation of Sec 370 as well as the division and reduced status of the State of Jammu & Kashmir,"" the Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said in a press statement.Chowdhury, who is also a five-time MP from Berhampore Lok Sabha seat in Murshidabad district, on Wednesday met family members of the five labourers who were killed by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.He called upon the ""learned"" journalists to do a thorough scanning of past 30 years of militancy and find out on how many occasions the internet was suspended.For now, the additional troops have been lodged in tents, government facilities, under-construction buildings, warehouses, abandoned homes and yatri campsDuring the two-day visit, the EU MPs are expected to be briefed by government officials on the prevailing situation in the Kashmir Valley as well as other parts of J&K.This comes as a diplomatic outreach by the Centre to counter Pakistan's narrative on the situation in the Kashmir Valley and to provide a ""clear view"" of India's development and governance priorities""I am surprised that the MEA has arranged for European Union MPs, in their private capacity [Not EU's official delegation], to visit Kashmir area of J&K. This is a perversion of our national policy. I urge the government cancel this visit because it is immoral,"" Swamy said.Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Barely 48 hours after the BJP pulled out of the alliance with the PDP in Kashmir, online debates on revoking Article 370 have gathered steam. BJP MP in Rajya Sabha Subramanian Swamy in a tweet Wednesday claimed to have written to the PMO on “why Article 370 can be deleted without Parliament concurrence, and by a Presidential concurrence”.ThePrint asks – Article 370: Can Modi revoke it before 2019 and will it heal or hit Kashmir’s ties with rest of India?R. Jagannathan
Editorial director, SwarajyaArticle 370 needs to be revoked for a simple reason –whatever be the historical reasons for its insertion into the Constitution, we can’t have a situation where some states are more equal than the others.It is an abomination because the only real reason it is there is because Jammu and Kashmir happens to have a Muslim majority. It actually sends a wrong message to the Hindu majority for it confirms their belief that minorities can get away with anything. But the essence of Article 370, which means giving states more powers, should be extended to all states. If this balancing is done, neither Kashmiris nor the rest of the Indian states should have a reason to complain.The BJP cannot possibly unilaterally repeal it, especially in the context of 2019, because the opposition is building an anti-BJP coalition to defeat it. It would cleave the nation like never before.Ideally, Article 370 should be repealed by Parliament, but then we have the precedent of Article 35A, which was inserted without parliamentary approval. The BJP could well ask: If Article 35A can be brought in through executive effort alone, why can’t Article 370 go the same way? However, unilateral repeal will alienate Kashmiri Muslims, who think Article 370 is the bare minimum they can accept to remain in India.It is possible for the BJP to help polarise voters by making Article 370’s repeal a core issue for 2019. But outside Kashmir, it has relatively low resonance, and a shift back to basic ideology – which it was willing to sacrifice for power in Jammu and Kashmir – will sound opportunistic.So, while the article must go in some time, 2019 is not the time to go full steam ahead with its repeal.Aman M. Hingorani
Advocate on Record & Mediator, Supreme Court and author of Unravelling the Kashmir KnotArticle 370 reflects the terms of the instrument of accession executed by the sovereign ruler of Jammu and Kashmir in favour of India on 26 October 1947, whereby only the areas of external affairs, communication and defence were ceded to India.Article 370 preserves the state’s autonomy and leaves it to the state’s Constituent Assembly to further determine its constitutional relationship with India. Indeed, the recommendation of the state’s Constituent Assembly is required under Article 370(3) before the President can declare the article inoperative. The present government, being a creation of the Indian Constitution, is bound by these terms.Now, the state’s Constituent Assembly, set up by its sovereign ruler in 1951, dispersed after framing the state’s Constitution in 1957 and without making any recommendation qua Article 370. Hence, the competence of New Delhi to declare Article 370 inoperative no longer exists, thus rendering this debate irrelevant. Nor would any attempt to equate the state’s Constituent Assembly, referred to in Article 370, with the state legislative assembly come to New Delhi’s rescue because that would make a mockery of New Delhi’s commitment to the state to preserve its autonomy as a pre-condition to its accession to India.My book ‘Unravelling the Kashmir Knot’ details how such commitment has nonetheless been progressively eroded by emasculating Article 370 beyond recognition so that it does not come in the way of New Delhi dealing with the state in any manner it chooses – a regrettable state of affairs that continues till date.Hakim Yasir Abbas
Assistant professor, School of Law
University of KashmirSubramanian Swamy’s recent tweet about Article 370 while being correct is far from being the complete truth. He is right when he says that revoking Article 370 only requires a Presidential notification of a cabinet resolution.Swamy, however, fails to inform his 7.37 million Twitter followers that while he is accusing others of being ignorant of the Constitution, the same Constitution provides in Clause 3 of Article 370 that such notification cannot happen without the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Therefore, the power given to the President to revoke Article 370 is not something that the President can invoke unilaterally on behest of the Prime Minister and his cabinet.Had that been the case, the BJP would have been able to revoke Article 370 as soon as it came to power in 2014 and, more so, when it formed the coalition government with the PDP in 2015. Its failure to do so is also the reason why attempts have been made to exploit the judicial machinery to scrap Article 370 (and Article 35A). The BJP is trying to use the courts in order to circumvent the barrier created by Clause 3 of Article 370.However, assuming that the BJP is able to revoke Article 370 on its own, doing so would have serious repercussions as far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned. While the BJP may (legally) achieve territorial integration, such integration will be devoid of any political and demographical mandate. Kashmir will integrate, but Kashmiris (including those who are part of mainstream political demography) will be alienated.Arjimand Hussain Talib
Editor-in-chief, Ziraat TimesIt is not possible to revoke Article 370 and there are firm constitutional and technical grounds for that.The idea of revoking it does, understandably, excite the BJP’s political constituency. Little wonder the party had made a promise to scrap the law in its 2014 election manifesto.At the outset of forming a coalition government with the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir in 2014, the BJP committed itself to safeguard the Article 370 in its agenda of alliance.Then came the watershed development on 4 April 2018 when the Supreme Court bench, consisting of Justices Adarsh K. Goel and R.F. Nariman, observed that “it is impossible to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, conferring special status on Jammu and Kashmir, because it has acquired permanent status through [its] years of existence.”Now let us assume that the Modi government moots a proposal in the Parliament under Article 368 ahead of the 2019 elections to abrogate Article 370. It can, but any amendment to the article will not apply to Jammu and Kashmir without the ratification of the state’s legislative assembly.Moreover, in conjunction with Article 370, the presidential order for 1954 provided that no bill to increase or diminish the area of Jammu and Kashmir, or altering its name or the boundaries, can be introduced in Parliament without the consent of the state legislature.It is possible that by keeping the state assembly under suspended animation, the BJP is planning the formation of a government, with certain permutations and combinations in Jammu and Kashmir, which is favourable to such a situation.National Conference leader and former CM Omar Abdullah said on 17 April 2014 that “accession will end if Article 370 is scrapped because the accession is dependent on it”.Senior PDP leader and constitutional lawyer Muzaffar Hussain Beig is of the opinion that the Article 1, under which Jammu and Kashmir is included as a territory of India, has been applied to the state under Article 370 and that if Article 370 goes, Article 1 will automatically cease to apply to the state.Given the slide in the BJP’s popularity and its electoral prospects in 2019, it is possible that the party is contemplating an attempt towards abrogation of Article 370. Such a course would be a disaster for the prospects of durable peace and stability in Jammu & Kashmir. It could also mark an irretrievable trough in the New Delhi-Srinagar relationship.Junaid Mattu
Spokesperson, National ConferenceThe revocation of Article 370 has been and will continue to be the go-to rallying point for the hard-core nationalist narrative, especially ahead of the general elections.This rallying cry doesn’t hinge on constitutional or political realities so the question of the Article’s revocation is purely theoretical – again distorted and supported by half-baked reasoning. The Article apart from being a constitutional chord between the Union and the state is also perhaps the only political basis on which the state builds its rationale for the continued status of its dignified existence within the Union.While I am of the strong belief that the revocation of the Article is beyond the constitutional and legislative reach of the Union, the country’s institutions lately have sprung up many surprises that redefine the probability of such a misadventure. People in Jammu and Kashmir have been weary of such designs since 2013 when the BJP manifesto clearly mentioned the revocation of Article 370 as a cornerstone of its Kashmir policy.This sense of anxiety within the state has been further fuelled by regular statements from senior BJP leaders supporting the revocation. The disillusionment in the Valley has been in part stoked by repeated attempts to distort and villainise the state’s special status as a challenge to the Union’s integrity. Nothing could be farther from the truth. However, this narrative has not allowed constitutionality or the possible implications of such a step in the state to get in its way.Any assault on the remnants of the special status will destroy whatever little credibility Jammu and Kashmir and its institutions have left in the State. Those who believe the revocation of Article 370 will facilitate ‘integration’ are oblivious to the genesis of the turmoil in Kashmir in 1953 – which has manifested itself in recurring periods of conflict.As the state continues to be on the brink after three years of misrule and ideological U-turns, even an indication of a judicial or legislative review of Article 370 could be the tipping point – and this time around the turmoil would be unprecedented.Mehboob Beg
PDP SpokespersonSupreme Court, who is the last word on legal subjects, has delivered a judgment on Article 370, saying the fundamentals of the Indian Constitution can neither be amended and nor can there be any question of revoking it. For me, Article 370 forms the fundamentals of Jammu and Kashmir’s relationship with the Union. And if one starts tampering with the basics, it will open up Pandora’s box. It would mean that one is questioning the relationship itself.The ground situation in Kashmir says loud and clear that people want more federal powers than they have right now. Mehbooba Mufti is right when she says that a muscular policy will not help solve the Kashmir tangle, and we must treat the state as our own.The weakening of Article 370 will weaken the people of Kashmir. Revocation of the article is wishful thinking which cannot happen legally. J&K is the only state which negotiated its relationship with the Union. These legal protections form the basis of such a relationship.One can expect anything from Subramanian Swamy. He is entitled to his will but Article 370 has political undertones. We are proud of being part of a secular, democratic India which gave us certain legal guarantees. We rejected a theocratic state like Pakistan, and that was always an option. Maharaja Hari Singh perhaps didn’t want to join India, but we being Muslims still wanted to join a secular India. Why did Swamy pick on Jammu and Kashmir? He should follow Vajpayee ji’s ideals for peace in the Valley, if not our advice.Apurva Vishwananth
Special Correspondent, ThePrintThe political ground for Article 370 has been shaky under the Modi government and the unease in the state is now at its worst. The government is unlikely to shy away from reviving the debate.Abrogating the provision was in the BJP’s 2014 manifesto. The government initially did try to play mischief by refusing to file affidavits in the Supreme Court and clarifying their position by saying that there is a need for ‘wider’ national discussion on the Article.But a few months later, the PDP-BJP government itself told the court that the permanent stature of Article 370 has been settled. The Supreme Court has indeed, in at least two instances, ruled that Article 370 has attained a permanent status in the Indian Constitution.So, the stumbling block for the Modi government to repeal and amend Article 370 will be a legal one.Article 368, which allows amendments to the Constitution, also does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir unless it is through an order of the President in accordance with Article 370. And, this requires the concurrence of the state government and ratification by the assembly.The conversation on revoking Article 370 will yield political mileage for 2019, but there’s little that the Modi government can do in reality.The Indian government has a constitutional duty to give Kashmir under Article 370 and some other states under Article 371 special treatment. An attempt to alter the provision strikes not just Kashmir but federalism because political sovereignty in India is shared between the union and its states.Compiled by Kritika Banerjee and Divya NarayananThePrint is now on Telegram. For the best reports & opinion on politics, governance and more, subscribe to ThePrint on Telegram.Article 370 exists in both, in GOI Constitution and in JK Assembly Constitution. Any correction or removal must take place signe and sealed by all stake holders. The teouble is the ones who hold JK Assembly powers are 3 to 5 families of long time Muslim heritage who will not make that change and the people of JK will go their representatives sides because they have not seen the fruits of GOI Constitution yet. GOI can not literally buy the JK people’s opinion unless they teach them, bribe them, put them in India with big rewards, and simply hope they will elect only those leaders in JK Assembly who will be proponents of any changes including removal of 370. It’s a catch 22. J. Nehru caused all this to happen. India can physically then, take full control of JK’s electoral process and for some reasons jail these families representatives, and replace them with those who will bring about these changes including removal. Another way is to attack JK and redraft / remove anything GOI does not like. That is called a Civil War.Like all things in life, nothing is permanent, not even the planets let alone the constitutions of India.  They are not set in stones and can never be permanent.  Constitutions are created to facilitate the working of a government and not to obstruct its efficiency.  They are not permanent and the Supreme Court’s opinion that Article 370 has attained a permanent status in the Indian constitution is itself restricted to time and the culture prevailing in a country. If the people of India demand a change in the constitution of India, only an authoritarian government will ignore the democratic will of its majority electorate.  India is a democratic country and it must be governed according to the wishes of its citizens. A nationwide referendum to gauge the views of the majority of Indians with regard to Article 370 will authenticate the true nature of Indian democracy. Any Indian piece of land whether it is in Andaman and Nicobar Islands or in Kashmir belong to all Indians, and not just or exclusively to their local inhabitants. All forms of privileges are unfair, discriminatory and misallocation of resources. Inequality of treatment whether in citizenship, economic opportunities or physical movement is backwardness and against fundamental human rights. The consequence of upholding Article 370 is itself anti-constitutional.Teh experts talk about the consequences, but a plain reading makes it clear that president can do it but not before seeking consent of constituent assembly of jk, which has been abolished in 1957. So first the constituent assembly is to be created to seek consent but that would be mean the abrogation of the accession signed by the then  constituent assembly, a legal herdl.Its abomination to read a senior journalist like Mr Jagannathan casually stating that historical events and facts don’t matter in governing of the nation.Its abomination again to read Mr Jagannathan informing the readers that Article 370 is there in the statute, just to appease “MUSLIMS”.Mr Jagannathan, dose the instrument of accession signed between the Union of India and the sovereign ruler, of J & K, by the way a “HINDU” betray the sentiments expressed by you in your piece?Apurva there was no ruling that happened with respect to Article 370. It was just a observation. So please do not give wrong information and claim you  are a journalist.Save my details",political,0

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Narendra Modi government on Monday moved to dramatically alter the status quo in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government ended days of speculation by making public its decision to effectively revoke the controversial Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.Article 370 accords special status to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag and rights. On Monday morning, home minister Amit Shah rose in Rajya Sabha to announce that the government was moving a Presidential order for Parliament's ratification.The Presidential order used a clause of Article 370 to say that provisions of Article 370 would no longer be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir, a move that essentially revokes the article without actually doing so.In a follow-up, but equally bold move, Amit Shah also said the government was moving a bill to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories -- Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. While the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir would have a legislature, a la Delhi, Ladakh would not.The Narendra Modi government's historic decision on Jammu and Kashmir, which ranks among the most unprecedented political moves in the country, will be debated for days, even weeks to come. Here is everything you need to know about what happened on Monday.What did the government do today?The government today moved a resolution to effectively abolish Article 370, which gives special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government also introduced a Bill to divide the state into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh.So Jammu and Kashmir is no longer a state?Short answer: Not yet. The Rajya Sabha has passed the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill which bifurcates the state into two Union territories. The Lok Sabha (where the BJP has a brute majority) now must pass the Bill, which will then go to the President for his assent. Once the President signs the Bill and the government issues a notification, Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be a state.READ | Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh: This is how the redrawn map will look likeBasically:And, what about Article 370? Has it been scrapped?Technically: No. As of now, the government has used a clause within Article 370 to make the provisions of the article inoperative.Let us explain.READ | How govt used Article 370 to kill Article 370What even is Article 370?Article 370 is an enabling provision. It explains which parts of the Indian Constitution have jurisdiction over Jammu and Kashmir, which adopted a separate state constitution for itself during the 1950s.According to it, the Central government needs the concurrence of J&K state government for applying laws. Now that changes.READ | Article 370 has not been scrapped. What does Modi govt move on Kashmir mean?So what happens to Article 35A?Article 35A, making a distinction between the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir and the outsiders, will also cease to have any effect in Jammu and Kashmir.Why did the government move to revoke the powers of Article 370?Revoking Article 370 of the Constitution has been a key part of the BJP's core agenda and has always struck an emotional chord with its rank and file after its ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee died in a Jammu and Kashmir jail in 1953 to protest the state's special status and demand its complete integration with the Union.Apart from ideology, the Modi government:Has anybody supported the Modi government on its Article 370 move?Yes, apart from NDA allies Shiv Sena, RPI, Akali Dal and others, regional parties like BSP, AAP, BJD, TRS and AIADMK extended full support to the resolution to effectively scrap Article 370 and the Bill to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir. You can read all about that here.How has the Valley reacted to these developments?Since communication in the Valley is currently snapped, there are no first-person reports from the ground.The situation in Kashmir Valley appeared to be ""under control"" as no untoward incident was reported on Monday.However, this can be attributed to the fact authorities have imposed curfew in Kishtwar and Rajouri districts and in the Banihal area of Ramban district, while restrictions were imposed in many districts of Jammu division and Srinagar.NOTE: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, who were under house arrest since Sunday night, have been arrested. Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference leaders Sajjad Lone and Imran Ansari have also been arrested.What is the Opposition saying on these developments related to Jammu and Kashmir?Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement evoked strong protests from the opposition with leaders of Congress, TMC, DMK, NCP and Left raising slogans and storming the well of the House.Some opposition parties termed the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two union territories as a ""black spot"". While Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad Monday said that the state's head, considered as India's crown, has been ""chopped off"" and its identity removed, TMC MP Derek O'Brien said that the Centre was committing ""procedural harakiri"".READ | Today we lost Kashmir: Kapil Sibal accuses govt of evading debate on Article 370Why were all eyes on Amit Shah today?READ | J&K to become state again when the time is right, says Amit ShahSo, what's next for Jammu and Kashmir?Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

Article 35A, 370 have been standing in the way of development. No one goes there to invest.

It needs to be reviewed,"" the Prime Minister said.On Monday, Modi-led government took a historic decision by revoking Article 370 of the Constitution that grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The revocation follows the Centre's introduction of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill in Parliament. Home Minister Amit Shah, who addressed the Rajya Sabha said that the state of Jammu and Kashmir will be bifurcated into two Union Territories - the Union Territory of Ladakh and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

According to Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy's (CMIE) monthly time-series data on unemployment, Jammu & Kashmir had the highest monthly average unemployment rate of 15 per cent between January 2016 and July 2019 among all the states. It is more than double the national monthly average unemployment rate of 6.4 per cent during the period.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Narendra Modi government on Monday moved to dramatically alter the status quo in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government ended days of speculation by making public its decision to effectively revoke the controversial Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.Article 370 accords special status to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag and rights. On Monday morning, home minister Amit Shah rose in Rajya Sabha to announce that the government was moving a Presidential order for Parliament's ratification.The Presidential order used a clause of Article 370 to say that provisions of Article 370 would no longer be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir, a move that essentially revokes the article without actually doing so.In a follow-up, but equally bold move, Amit Shah also said the government was moving a bill to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories -- Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. While the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir would have a legislature, a la Delhi, Ladakh would not.The Narendra Modi government's historic decision on Jammu and Kashmir, which ranks among the most unprecedented political moves in the country, will be debated for days, even weeks to come. Here is everything you need to know about what happened on Monday.What did the government do today?The government today moved a resolution to effectively abolish Article 370, which gives special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government also introduced a Bill to divide the state into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh.So Jammu and Kashmir is no longer a state?Short answer: Not yet. The Rajya Sabha has passed the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill which bifurcates the state into two Union territories. The Lok Sabha (where the BJP has a brute majority) now must pass the Bill, which will then go to the President for his assent. Once the President signs the Bill and the government issues a notification, Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be a state.READ | Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh: This is how the redrawn map will look likeBasically:And, what about Article 370? Has it been scrapped?Technically: No. As of now, the government has used a clause within Article 370 to make the provisions of the article inoperative.Let us explain.READ | How govt used Article 370 to kill Article 370What even is Article 370?Article 370 is an enabling provision. It explains which parts of the Indian Constitution have jurisdiction over Jammu and Kashmir, which adopted a separate state constitution for itself during the 1950s.According to it, the Central government needs the concurrence of J&K state government for applying laws. Now that changes.READ | Article 370 has not been scrapped. What does Modi govt move on Kashmir mean?So what happens to Article 35A?Article 35A, making a distinction between the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir and the outsiders, will also cease to have any effect in Jammu and Kashmir.Why did the government move to revoke the powers of Article 370?Revoking Article 370 of the Constitution has been a key part of the BJP's core agenda and has always struck an emotional chord with its rank and file after its ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee died in a Jammu and Kashmir jail in 1953 to protest the state's special status and demand its complete integration with the Union.Apart from ideology, the Modi government:Has anybody supported the Modi government on its Article 370 move?Yes, apart from NDA allies Shiv Sena, RPI, Akali Dal and others, regional parties like BSP, AAP, BJD, TRS and AIADMK extended full support to the resolution to effectively scrap Article 370 and the Bill to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir. You can read all about that here.How has the Valley reacted to these developments?Since communication in the Valley is currently snapped, there are no first-person reports from the ground.The situation in Kashmir Valley appeared to be ""under control"" as no untoward incident was reported on Monday.However, this can be attributed to the fact authorities have imposed curfew in Kishtwar and Rajouri districts and in the Banihal area of Ramban district, while restrictions were imposed in many districts of Jammu division and Srinagar.NOTE: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, who were under house arrest since Sunday night, have been arrested. Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference leaders Sajjad Lone and Imran Ansari have also been arrested.What is the Opposition saying on these developments related to Jammu and Kashmir?Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement evoked strong protests from the opposition with leaders of Congress, TMC, DMK, NCP and Left raising slogans and storming the well of the House.Some opposition parties termed the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two union territories as a ""black spot"". While Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad Monday said that the state's head, considered as India's crown, has been ""chopped off"" and its identity removed, TMC MP Derek O'Brien said that the Centre was committing ""procedural harakiri"".READ | Today we lost Kashmir: Kapil Sibal accuses govt of evading debate on Article 370Why were all eyes on Amit Shah today?READ | J&K to become state again when the time is right, says Amit ShahSo, what's next for Jammu and Kashmir?Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe biggest decision of the Narendra Modi government came shortly after 50 days of the beginning of its second term. The government on Monday moved Parliament to remove the special status provision to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, revoking 1954 Presidential proclamation through a gazette notification.With that revocation order, Article 35A no longer exists. The article defined the permanent resident of Jammu and Kashmir and also defined the state's relationship with the Centre, and barred non-permanent residents from permanently settling in J&K. It also gives rights of buying immovable property, acquiring land, applying for government jobs, any kind of scholarships and aids, and other public welfare projects to state domicile.Once the President revokes the order, the special status of the status will be withdrawn. This paves way for what the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long believed - Ek Nishan, Ek Vidhan aur Ek Pradhan (One flag, one Constitution and one leader).Here are some of the significant changes in Jammu and Kashmir:1. J&K Constitution scrappedBefore Article 370 - It was the only state with its own Constitution. The article provided J&K provisions of the Constitution which were not applicable to other states of the country including special autonomy, separate state laws, etc.After Article 370 - With the scrapping provisions of Article 370, the separate Constitution ceases to exist.2. Separate flagBefore Article 370 - The J&K state had two different flags - India and the state.After Article 370 - There would be no separate flag for the state.(Sources, however, said that a decision could be taken on it as Karnataka, too, has proposed its own flag)3. Any Indian can now buy properties in J&KBefore Article 370 - Only residents of J&K could buy and sell properties in the state.After Article 370 - Any Indian citizen will be able to buy and sell properties in J&K.4. CRPC in, RPC outBefore Article 370 - Residents of J&K had separate laws related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights.After Article 370 - There will be no separate laws for the citizens of J&K. Crpc will be in, Ranbir Penal Code of the state will be out.5. The state becomes a Union TerritoryBefore Article 370 - Jammu and Kashmir was a state with special status.After Article 370 - J&K downsized to a Union Territory (UT) with legislature while Ladakh becomes the UT without any legislature.Riots in India are decreasing but becoming more intense: NCRB dataWhat's brewing up in Congress with Sonia back as party chief, dissenters growing?6 murders over 14 years: The Kerala housewife who killed her family for moneyIs ED heat on Opposition a witch-hunt?

"Women, Dalits, tribals and minorities of Jammu and Kashmir are now equal citizens of IndiaSince 5 August, when the government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), the floodgates of righteous rage from the usual suspects from India and the rest of the world have opened. Hardly surprising. This was the jackboot, the blood-soaked end of democracy, a rape of the Constitution, the trampling of fundamental rights of Kashmiris, and so on. These hyperventilating flag-bearers of freedom (or whatever) should calm down and consider one historical fact. Which is this. The “temporary and transitional"" provision Article 370 made an exception to the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Indian Constitution. These fundamental rights have now been restored. And this is shockingly easy to explain.A New York Times columnist has wailed that the government has now converted “the people of Kashmir to second-class citizens, if not subjects"". Sorry, but the truth is that some of these people—specifically the male Kashmiri Muslim—enjoyed far greater rights than any other Indian citizen; they have now been brought down to equal status. And many other inhabitants of the erstwhile state had fewer rights than normal Indian citizens; they have been granted equality. One would think that anyone who believed in democracy would see that as a good thing.To explain this, we must come to “majoritarianism"", over which much chest-beating is going on. Some people have seen the government’s action as “unabashed majoritarianism"". Whereas, if there ever was any unabashed and constitutionally sanctioned majoritarianism anywhere in India, it was in J&K through Article 370. The Constitution of this Muslim-majority state did not have the word “minorities"" anywhere in it. Unlike in the Indian Constitution, their rights were not protected. J&K was also the only Indian state with no tribal rights (and the state had no right to education either). And it should be our national shame that we allow these hypocrites to freely talk of majoritarianism while staying silent about the 20th century’s swiftest forced exodus of a minority community—Hindu Pandits from Kashmir in 1990.There is extensive scare-mongering that the removal of Article 35A will lead to land grab by non-Kashmiris, because the law permitted ownership of immovable property in the state only by permanent residents (PRs). But this law also stipulated that J&K women who married non-PRs, lost their PR status and inheritance rights. When we spoke to an old family friend, a Kashmiri lady engineer married to a non-Kashmiri, who played a key role in the Chandrayaan-2 launch, she was tearful; all she could think of was building a little home in her homeland. Article 35A also ensured that the thousands of descendants of Valmikis (Dalits) who were brought in from Punjab as government sweepers in 1957 were never allowed to get any government jobs other than sweepers. And they could not even get a Scheduled Caste certificate from the state government, so were not eligible for any benefits under central schemes. Hindu and Sikh refugees from West Pakistan remained non-PR second-class citizens, while Uighur Muslims from Xinjiang were granted PR status. And we are supposed to believe that Kashmiri Muslims have become second-class citizens, when in reality, actual second-class citizens now have full citizen rights.Majoritarianism? Watch the video of Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal’s Lok Sabha speech on 6 August to know what majoritarian oppression means to a religious and ethnic minority. Fear is being spread about the government plotting demographic change in Kashmir, like China settling Han Chinese in Tibet. But systematic attempts to change demography have been in progress for years in J&K, through settling Muslims in Buddhist-majority Ladakh (Namgyal mentioned this), and recently, Rohingyas in Jammu.The vast majority of Indians have never understood why J&K deserved special status, and certainly Sardar Patel and B.R. Ambedkar were vehemently opposed to Article 370. Patel told his secretary, V. Shankar: “Jawaharlal royega (Jawaharlal will weep over this)"", and Ambedkar refused to attend the session that passed the motion. And the fact that many Opposition parties supported the revocation, that even Congress is divided over it, obviously indicates that politicians know that the people of our democratic republic feel that it’s time for all Indians to be equal citizens.The real test begins now. With J&K a Union territory, the central government must ensure that funds are deployed properly and don’t line the pockets of a few families and their cronies. However, it will take time before industry feels that the valley is a safe bet. Pakistan will try to up its terrorist game. Also, when the US withdraws its troops from Afghanistan, some of the Taliban’s resources will be available to Pakistan to be re-directed towards Kashmir. But, most importantly, the doubting Kashmiri Muslim must realize that Article 370 made him special in a very negative way. It kept him alienated from his nation for seven decades. No Malayali, Gujarati, Assamese, and no Dogra or Ladakhi has lost his identity because he is an Indian. India has opened her arms. It is now up to sceptical Kashmiris to accept the offer.Sandipan Deb is a former editor of ‘Financial Express’, and founder-editor of ‘Open’ and ‘Swarajya’ magazinesLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIndia's BJP-led government is hailing its decision to strip the state of Jammu and Kashmir of autonomy after seven decades, characterising it as the correction of a ""historical blunder"". The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi explains why this has happened and why it's important.Kashmir is a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan say is fully theirs.The area was once a princely state called Jammu and Kashmir, but it joined India in 1947 soon after the sub-continent was divided up at the end of British rule.India and Pakistan subsequently went to war over it and each came to control different parts of the territory with a ceasefire line agreed.There has been violence in the Indian-administered side - the state of Jammu and Kashmir - for 30 years due to a separatist insurgency against Indian rule.In the first few days of August, there were signs of something afoot in Kashmir.Tens of thousands of additional Indian troops were deployed, a major Hindu pilgrimage was cancelled, schools and colleges were shut, tourists were ordered to leave, telephone and internet services were suspended and regional political leaders were placed under house arrest.But most of the speculation was that Article 35A of the Indian constitution, which gave some special privileges to the people of the state, would be scrapped.The government then stunned everyone by saying it was revoking nearly all of Article 370, which 35A is part of and which has been the basis of Kashmir's complex relationship with India for some 70 years.The article allowed the state a certain amount of autonomy - its own constitution, a separate flag and freedom to make laws. Foreign affairs, defence and communications remained the preserve of the central government.As a result, Jammu and Kashmir could make its own rules relating to permanent residency, ownership of property and fundamental rights. It could also bar Indians from outside the state from purchasing property or settling there.The constitutional provision has underpinned India's often fraught relationship with Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority region to join India at partition.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party had long opposed Article 370 and revoking it was in the party's 2019 election manifesto.They argued it needed to be scrapped to integrate Kashmir and put it on the same footing as the rest of India. After returning to power with a massive mandate in the April-May general elections, the government lost no time in acting on its pledge.Critics of Monday's move are linking it to the economic slowdown that India is currently facing - they say it provides a much-needed diversion for the government.Many Kashmiris believe that the BJP ultimately wants to change the demographic character of the Muslim-majority region by allowing non-Kashmiris to buy land there.Although Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement in parliament on Monday came as a surprise to most Indians, it would have taken the government some preparation to arrive at the decision.The move also fits in with Mr Modi's desire to show that the BJP is tough on Kashmir, and Pakistan.Kashmir will no longer have a separate constitution but will have to abide by the Indian constitution much like any other state.All Indian laws will be automatically applicable to Kashmiris, and people from outside the state will be able to buy property there.The government says this will bring development to the region.""I want to tell the people of Jammu and Kashmir what damage Articles 370 and 35A did to the state,"" Mr Shah told parliament. ""It's because of these sections that democracy was never fully implemented, corruption increased in the state, that no development could take place.""The government is also moving to break up the state into two smaller, federally administered territories. One region will combine Muslim-majority Kashmir and Hindu-majority Jammu. The other is Buddhist-majority Ladakh, which is culturally and historically close to Tibet.P Chidambaram, a senior leader in the opposition Congress Party described the decision as a ""catastrophic step"" and warned in parliament that it could have serious consequences.""You may think you have scored a victory, but you are wrong and history will prove you to be wrong. Future generations will realise what a grave mistake this house is making today,"" he said.According to the constitution, Article 370 could only be modified with the agreement of the ""state government"". But there hasn't been much of a state government in Jammu and Kashmir for over a year now.In June last year, India imposed federal rule after the government of the then chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, was reduced to a minority. This meant the federal government only had to seek the consent of the governor who imposes its rule.The government says it is well within its rights to bring in the changes and that similar decisions have been taken by federal governments in the past.But expert opinion is sharply divided.One constitutional expert, Subhash Kashyap, told news agency ANI that the order was ""constitutionally sound"" and that ""no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it"".However another constitutional expert, AG Noorani, told BBC Hindi it was ""an illegal decision, akin to committing fraud"" that could be challenged in the Supreme Court.Opposition political parties could launch a legal challenge but Kashmir is an emotive issue with many Indians, and most parties would be wary of opposing the move lest they be branded anti-India.That could leave any challenge up to individuals or activists.Lt Col Alexander Vindman listened to the phone call that sparked the impeachment inquiry against the US president.Have you been getting these songs wrong?What happens to your body in extreme heat?",political,0

What are Article 370 and 35A? Are they amendable? If abrogated can it solve the long standing political dispute in Jammu and Kashmir?

Here's an explainer on Article 35A and 370

Article 370 grants an autonomous status to J&K, while Article 35A, incorporated into the Constitution in 1954, provides special rights and privileges to the citizens of the state.

What the two articles mean:

Article 370

History

		In October 1947, the then-Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir signed the ‘Instrument of Accession’, which specified three subjects on which Jammu and Kashmir would transfer its powers to the government of India: 1. Foreign affairs, 2. Defence and 3. Communications. In March 1948, the Maharaja appointed an interim government in the state, with Sheikh Abdullah as the prime minister. In July 1949, Sheikh Abdullah and three other colleagues joined the Indian Constituent Assembly and negotiated the special status of J&K, leading to the adoption of Article 370. The controversial provision was drafted by Sheikh Abdullah.

What are the provisions of Article 370?

		Parliament needs the Jammu & Kashmir government's nod for applying laws in the state — except defence, foreign affairs, finance, and communications.

		The law of citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights of the residents of Jammu & Kashmir is different from the residents living in rest of India. Under Article 370, citizens from other states cannot buy property in Jammu & Kashmir. Under Article 370, the Centre has no power to declare financial emergency.

		It is important to note Article 370(1)(c) explicitly mentions that Article 1 of the Indian Constitution applies to Kashmir through Article 370. Article 1 lists the states of the Union. This means that it is Article 370 that binds the state of J&K to the Indian Union. Removing Article 370, which can be done by a Presidential Order, would therefore make the state independent of India.

Temporary provision or not?

		A petition filed by Kumari Vijayalakshmi Jha challenged the validity of Article 370 against the Delhi High Court's April 11, 2017 order. The petition had said that the continuance of the temporary provision of Article 370 even after dissolution of Constituent Assembly of J&K, and that of J&K Constitution, which has never got the assent of the President of India or Parliament or the government of India, ""amounts to fraud on the basic structure of our Constitution"".

Article 35A

What is it?

		Article 35A gives the Jammu & Kashmir Legislature full discretionary power to decide who the 'permanent residents' of the state are. It gives them special rights and privileges regarding employment with the state government, acquisition of property in the state, settling in the state, and the right to scholarships and other forms of aid that the state government provides. It also allows the state legislature to impose any restrictions upon persons other than the permanent residents regarding the above.

		To guarantee these special rights and privileges, the Article says no act of the state legislature that comes under it can be challenged for violating the Constitution or any other laws.

What will happen if Article 35A is repealed?

		Repealment of Article 35A by the Supreme Court of India or by the government will have some far-reaching implications. Before Article 35A was introduced to the Constitution of India, the Governor and the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir were addressed as the Sadr-e-Riyasat (President) and Wazir-e-Azam (Prime Minister). There's a possibility that if Article 35A is repealed, it would lead J&K back to the same arrangement.

		The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of India would also be curtailed. The legal control of the Centre over Jammu and Kashmir would be limited only to the matters of Defence, External Affairs and Communication.

Which parties are against the removal of Articles 35A and 370

		All Kashmir valley based parties, including the National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (J&KPM) and others are opposed to any tinkering with Articles 35A and 370 that give a special status to J&K. The Congress party also wants these articles to be protected. Congress leaders maintain that senior leaders of the party, including late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had painstakingly worked out J&K's relationship with India through promises made in these articles. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has warned the Centre against the revocation of Article 35A, saying any tinkering with the constitutional provision would be akin to setting a powder keg on fire. Mufti asked her party workers to get ready for a big fight for the protection of Article 35A, which gives special rights and privileges to the state's permanent residents.

		""We want to tell the central government that tinkering with Article 35A will be akin to setting a powder keg on fire,"" the PDP president said. ""If any hand tries to touch Article 35A, not only that hand, but that whole body will be burnt to ashes.""

		Mufti said they would fight till death any attempt to tinker with the state's special status.

Who wants Articles 35A and 370 removed?

		Among the centrist mainstream parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands for abrogation of these articles arguing they are roadblocks not only to the integration of the state with the rest of the country but also in the development of J&K.Rumours are afloat that the Modi-led government is set to scrap Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution. The rumours were triggered by reports of Centre deploying additional paramilitary troops to address the likely fallout from the removal of the controversial Article 35A in J&K. The government has, however, said that these are precautionary measures in view of terrorist threats. Meanwhile, various political leaders including former Chief Ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti have been placed under house arrest. Mobile internet services have also been barred.The rumours reflect apprehensions in the Valley following Home Minister Amit Shah’s pointed statement in Parliament that Article 370, which deals with the special status of J&K, was “temporary in nature” and “not permanent”. While Jammu wants the provision to be scrapped from the Constitution, Kashmir valley-centric parties, across the board, warn that tampering with the special provision would stir the hornets' nest and the fallout would be difficult to handle.document.write(""<!--"");if(isUserBanner==""free""&&(displayConBanner==1))document.write(""-->"");googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/6516239/outofpage_1x1_desktop','div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0').addService(googletag.pubads());googletag.pubads().enableSyncRendering();googletag.enableServices();});

What are Article 370 and 35A? Are they amendable? If abrogated can it solve the long standing political dispute in Jammu and Kashmir?

Here's an explainer on Article 35A and 370

Article 370 grants an autonomous status to J&K, while Article 35A, incorporated into the Constitution in 1954, provides special rights and privileges to the citizens of the state.

What the two articles mean:

Article 370

History

		In October 1947, the then-Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir signed the ‘Instrument of Accession’, which specified three subjects on which Jammu and Kashmir would transfer its powers to the government of India: 1. Foreign affairs, 2. Defence and 3. Communications. In March 1948, the Maharaja appointed an interim government in the state, with Sheikh Abdullah as the prime minister. In July 1949, Sheikh Abdullah and three other colleagues joined the Indian Constituent Assembly and negotiated the special status of J&K, leading to the adoption of Article 370. The controversial provision was drafted by Sheikh Abdullah.

What are the provisions of Article 370?

		Parliament needs the Jammu & Kashmir government's nod for applying laws in the state — except defence, foreign affairs, finance, and communications.

		The law of citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights of the residents of Jammu & Kashmir is different from the residents living in rest of India. Under Article 370, citizens from other states cannot buy property in Jammu & Kashmir. Under Article 370, the Centre has no power to declare financial emergency.

		It is important to note Article 370(1)(c) explicitly mentions that Article 1 of the Indian Constitution applies to Kashmir through Article 370. Article 1 lists the states of the Union. This means that it is Article 370 that binds the state of J&K to the Indian Union. Removing Article 370, which can be done by a Presidential Order, would therefore make the state independent of India.

Temporary provision or not?

		A petition filed by Kumari Vijayalakshmi Jha challenged the validity of Article 370 against the Delhi High Court's April 11, 2017 order. The petition had said that the continuance of the temporary provision of Article 370 even after dissolution of Constituent Assembly of J&K, and that of J&K Constitution, which has never got the assent of the President of India or Parliament or the government of India, ""amounts to fraud on the basic structure of our Constitution"".

Article 35A

What is it?

		Article 35A gives the Jammu & Kashmir Legislature full discretionary power to decide who the 'permanent residents' of the state are. It gives them special rights and privileges regarding employment with the state government, acquisition of property in the state, settling in the state, and the right to scholarships and other forms of aid that the state government provides. It also allows the state legislature to impose any restrictions upon persons other than the permanent residents regarding the above.

		To guarantee these special rights and privileges, the Article says no act of the state legislature that comes under it can be challenged for violating the Constitution or any other laws.

What will happen if Article 35A is repealed?

		Repealment of Article 35A by the Supreme Court of India or by the government will have some far-reaching implications. Before Article 35A was introduced to the Constitution of India, the Governor and the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir were addressed as the Sadr-e-Riyasat (President) and Wazir-e-Azam (Prime Minister). There's a possibility that if Article 35A is repealed, it would lead J&K back to the same arrangement.

		The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of India would also be curtailed. The legal control of the Centre over Jammu and Kashmir would be limited only to the matters of Defence, External Affairs and Communication.

Which parties are against the removal of Articles 35A and 370

		All Kashmir valley based parties, including the National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement (J&KPM) and others are opposed to any tinkering with Articles 35A and 370 that give a special status to J&K. The Congress party also wants these articles to be protected. Congress leaders maintain that senior leaders of the party, including late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had painstakingly worked out J&K's relationship with India through promises made in these articles. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has warned the Centre against the revocation of Article 35A, saying any tinkering with the constitutional provision would be akin to setting a powder keg on fire. Mufti asked her party workers to get ready for a big fight for the protection of Article 35A, which gives special rights and privileges to the state's permanent residents.

		""We want to tell the central government that tinkering with Article 35A will be akin to setting a powder keg on fire,"" the PDP president said. ""If any hand tries to touch Article 35A, not only that hand, but that whole body will be burnt to ashes.""

		Mufti said they would fight till death any attempt to tinker with the state's special status.

Who wants Articles 35A and 370 removed?

		Among the centrist mainstream parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands for abrogation of these articles arguing they are roadblocks not only to the integration of the state with the rest of the country but also in the development of J&K.What are Article 370 and 35A?

"Keep Me Logged InThe Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) is in lockdown after the government revoked a special status granted to the troubled region.On Monday, Interior Minister Amit Shah told India's parliament that the central government would scrap Article 370, a constitutional provision that grants special status and allows the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir to make its own laws. The order was subsequently approved by the Indian President.CNBC takes a look at what this means for Kashmir and for the Muslim-majority state's relationship with India.Article 370 of the Indian constitution carves out a special status to the state of J&K. It also limits the Indian parliament's power to make laws for the state. In effect, the special status, which is described as ""temporary"" allows the state of Jammu & Kashmir to have its own constitution, its own flag and take decisions except for any matter that is related to defense and foreign affairs. The temporary provision was included in the constitution on 17 October, 1949.This special status dates back to the end of British rule in India in 1947 when Maharaja Hari Singh of the then colonized state of Jammu & Kashmir signed a Treaty of Accession for the state of J&K to join the Indian side.Meanwhile, Article 35a, which was added to the constitution in 1954 under Article 370 gives the state of Jammu & Kashmir the right to decide who its permanent residents are. The clause further gives special rights to residents in government jobs, when buying property in the state and for educational scholarships among others.The state defines its permanent residents as those that are ""born or settled within the state before 1911 or after having lawfully acquired immovable property and resident in the state for not less than 10 years before that date.""The law bans non-permanent residents from settling in the state, buying land, and taking government jobs or scholarships.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party had pushed for an end to Kashmir's special constitutional status, arguing that such laws had hindered its integration with the rest of India.India's government wants to strengthen its influence over its only Muslim-majority region.In the run up to the most recent elections in May this year, Modi's Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) had promised a firm policy action to bring peace in the Jammu & Kashmir region.""In the last five years, we have made all necessary efforts to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir through decisive actions and a firm policy. We are committed to overcoming all obstacles that come in the way of development and providing adequate financial resources to all the regions of the state. We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Article 370,"" according to the manifesto.On Monday, Interior Minister Amit Shah introduced the measure in parliament amid massive protests from the opposition as well as regional parties in J&K. Opposition parties have condemned the government's proposal, calling it ""undemocratic.""Shah also said the state will be divided into two union territories – Jammu & Kashmir, which will have its own legislature, and Ladakh, which will be ruled directly by the central government and will have no legislature of its own. A union territory is a type of administrative division in India. Unlike the states of India, which have their own governments, union territories are federal territories governed directly by the main government.India has deployed tens of thousands of troops across the Kashmir valley in anticipation of a backlash of the revoke.Indian authorities banned public movements, shut down schools and colleges indefinitely and put two former chief ministers of J&K — Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti — under house arrest ahead of the announcement.The two leaders took to Twitter to express their disappointment over the decision and warned of consequences.Indian media reports suggest that mobile internet services have been suspended in Kashmir Valley and Satellite phones were being used by security officials.Critics on Twitter have condemned the move, calling it ""authoritarianism."" Indian-author Ramachandra Guha blamed the government for taking action without a proper debate.On Monday, the Pakistan government strongly condemned India for taking ""illegal steps"" in its decision to revoke special status for Kashmir. This according to Reuters, citing a government statement.The Pakistan government also warned that it will ""exercise all possible options.""""As the party to this international dispute, Pakistan will exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps,"" Pakistan's foreign ministry said in a statement.India and Pakistan's conflict over the mountainous region of Kashmir dates back to 1947 when both countries became independent from British colonial rule.The entire subcontinent was partitioned into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan, which led to a mass displacement as people migrated from one country to the other. Outbreaks of communal and religious violence killed hundreds of thousands of people in the subcontinent during that time.Jammu and Kashmir was a former princely state where a large number of people were killed and others were driven away by the violence during the partition. Since then, India and Pakistan have fought multiple wars over the region — both countries claim the region in full but control only parts of it. Many have raised concerns over violence and human rights abuses in both India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, as well as in Pakistan-controlled Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan region.— CNBC's John Schoen contributed to this report.Got a confidential news tip?

"Holding placards against the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370, the two MPs urged the government to ""respect"" the special status of the region.The national capital witnessed a dip in pollution levels on November 16 morning even as the air quality in the city remained in the ""severe"" category.The trial runs, through the restive south Kashmir, were done after a thorough safety audit of the section, a railway official told PTI.Attributing the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to Modi's political will and Amit Shah's strategy, Nadda said by uprooting a ""70-year-old cancer"" within a month of coming to power for a second term, the prime minister has shown how a strong government works.BJP working president JP Nadda asked party functionaries to expose the ""blatant lie"" of Congress leaders which has hurt the country's image abroad, by raising questions on the transparency of defence deals in India.A 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice N V Ramana said that passing any interim order might lead to delay in the matter and the apex court would settle all the issues at one go after hearing all the parties.Article 35A became history on August 5 as a consequence of the Centre's decision to abrogate the provisions of Article 370 which had given special status to the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir.Addressing a press conference here, Congress spokesman Pawan Kheda said, ""Not once or twice, but the Congress party diluted article 370 as many as 12 times, but without letting any controversy break out.""Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday transitioned from a state into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, nearly three months after the NDA government abrogated the state's special status.The stick has been used to good effect, it’s now time to use the carrot .While bureaucratic structures are in place, the staff of the state administration is yet to be dividedReal estate experts feel it is still too early to gauge the real impact on Kashmir's real estate market. As of now, it is still a highly sensitive region and security concerns may keep property buyers at bay.The 59-year-old, who happens to be one of the youngest governors the country has had, has been a trusted aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi since the time he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.Reacting sharply to India's move to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to bring it in line with the rest of the country, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian envoy.India and Saudi Arabia are re-defining their foreign policy priorities: For New Delhi, Saudi Arabia and the Arab Gulf states are becoming key interlocutors in the Middle East. For Riyadh, India is one of the eight major powers with which it wants to forge strategic partnerships as part of its Vision 2030.The two UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh come into existence on Thursday after the central government on August 5 decided to abrogate the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and create them on October 31.Shah also said Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's unfullfilled dream of integrating Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country was accomplished on August 5 when Article 370 and 35A were repealed.The total number of states in India is now 28, while the total UTs will has gone up to nine""The CPI(M) reiterates its strong opposition to the abrogation of Sec 370 as well as the division and reduced status of the State of Jammu & Kashmir,"" the Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said in a press statement.Chowdhury, who is also a five-time MP from Berhampore Lok Sabha seat in Murshidabad district, on Wednesday met family members of the five labourers who were killed by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.He called upon the ""learned"" journalists to do a thorough scanning of past 30 years of militancy and find out on how many occasions the internet was suspended.For now, the additional troops have been lodged in tents, government facilities, under-construction buildings, warehouses, abandoned homes and yatri campsDuring the two-day visit, the EU MPs are expected to be briefed by government officials on the prevailing situation in the Kashmir Valley as well as other parts of J&K.This comes as a diplomatic outreach by the Centre to counter Pakistan's narrative on the situation in the Kashmir Valley and to provide a ""clear view"" of India's development and governance priorities""I am surprised that the MEA has arranged for European Union MPs, in their private capacity [Not EU's official delegation], to visit Kashmir area of J&K. This is a perversion of our national policy. I urge the government cancel this visit because it is immoral,"" Swamy said.Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Barely 48 hours after the BJP pulled out of the alliance with the PDP in Kashmir, online debates on revoking Article 370 have gathered steam. BJP MP in Rajya Sabha Subramanian Swamy in a tweet Wednesday claimed to have written to the PMO on “why Article 370 can be deleted without Parliament concurrence, and by a Presidential concurrence”.ThePrint asks – Article 370: Can Modi revoke it before 2019 and will it heal or hit Kashmir’s ties with rest of India?R. Jagannathan
Editorial director, SwarajyaArticle 370 needs to be revoked for a simple reason –whatever be the historical reasons for its insertion into the Constitution, we can’t have a situation where some states are more equal than the others.It is an abomination because the only real reason it is there is because Jammu and Kashmir happens to have a Muslim majority. It actually sends a wrong message to the Hindu majority for it confirms their belief that minorities can get away with anything. But the essence of Article 370, which means giving states more powers, should be extended to all states. If this balancing is done, neither Kashmiris nor the rest of the Indian states should have a reason to complain.The BJP cannot possibly unilaterally repeal it, especially in the context of 2019, because the opposition is building an anti-BJP coalition to defeat it. It would cleave the nation like never before.Ideally, Article 370 should be repealed by Parliament, but then we have the precedent of Article 35A, which was inserted without parliamentary approval. The BJP could well ask: If Article 35A can be brought in through executive effort alone, why can’t Article 370 go the same way? However, unilateral repeal will alienate Kashmiri Muslims, who think Article 370 is the bare minimum they can accept to remain in India.It is possible for the BJP to help polarise voters by making Article 370’s repeal a core issue for 2019. But outside Kashmir, it has relatively low resonance, and a shift back to basic ideology – which it was willing to sacrifice for power in Jammu and Kashmir – will sound opportunistic.So, while the article must go in some time, 2019 is not the time to go full steam ahead with its repeal.Aman M. Hingorani
Advocate on Record & Mediator, Supreme Court and author of Unravelling the Kashmir KnotArticle 370 reflects the terms of the instrument of accession executed by the sovereign ruler of Jammu and Kashmir in favour of India on 26 October 1947, whereby only the areas of external affairs, communication and defence were ceded to India.Article 370 preserves the state’s autonomy and leaves it to the state’s Constituent Assembly to further determine its constitutional relationship with India. Indeed, the recommendation of the state’s Constituent Assembly is required under Article 370(3) before the President can declare the article inoperative. The present government, being a creation of the Indian Constitution, is bound by these terms.Now, the state’s Constituent Assembly, set up by its sovereign ruler in 1951, dispersed after framing the state’s Constitution in 1957 and without making any recommendation qua Article 370. Hence, the competence of New Delhi to declare Article 370 inoperative no longer exists, thus rendering this debate irrelevant. Nor would any attempt to equate the state’s Constituent Assembly, referred to in Article 370, with the state legislative assembly come to New Delhi’s rescue because that would make a mockery of New Delhi’s commitment to the state to preserve its autonomy as a pre-condition to its accession to India.My book ‘Unravelling the Kashmir Knot’ details how such commitment has nonetheless been progressively eroded by emasculating Article 370 beyond recognition so that it does not come in the way of New Delhi dealing with the state in any manner it chooses – a regrettable state of affairs that continues till date.Hakim Yasir Abbas
Assistant professor, School of Law
University of KashmirSubramanian Swamy’s recent tweet about Article 370 while being correct is far from being the complete truth. He is right when he says that revoking Article 370 only requires a Presidential notification of a cabinet resolution.Swamy, however, fails to inform his 7.37 million Twitter followers that while he is accusing others of being ignorant of the Constitution, the same Constitution provides in Clause 3 of Article 370 that such notification cannot happen without the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Therefore, the power given to the President to revoke Article 370 is not something that the President can invoke unilaterally on behest of the Prime Minister and his cabinet.Had that been the case, the BJP would have been able to revoke Article 370 as soon as it came to power in 2014 and, more so, when it formed the coalition government with the PDP in 2015. Its failure to do so is also the reason why attempts have been made to exploit the judicial machinery to scrap Article 370 (and Article 35A). The BJP is trying to use the courts in order to circumvent the barrier created by Clause 3 of Article 370.However, assuming that the BJP is able to revoke Article 370 on its own, doing so would have serious repercussions as far as Jammu and Kashmir is concerned. While the BJP may (legally) achieve territorial integration, such integration will be devoid of any political and demographical mandate. Kashmir will integrate, but Kashmiris (including those who are part of mainstream political demography) will be alienated.Arjimand Hussain Talib
Editor-in-chief, Ziraat TimesIt is not possible to revoke Article 370 and there are firm constitutional and technical grounds for that.The idea of revoking it does, understandably, excite the BJP’s political constituency. Little wonder the party had made a promise to scrap the law in its 2014 election manifesto.At the outset of forming a coalition government with the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir in 2014, the BJP committed itself to safeguard the Article 370 in its agenda of alliance.Then came the watershed development on 4 April 2018 when the Supreme Court bench, consisting of Justices Adarsh K. Goel and R.F. Nariman, observed that “it is impossible to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, conferring special status on Jammu and Kashmir, because it has acquired permanent status through [its] years of existence.”Now let us assume that the Modi government moots a proposal in the Parliament under Article 368 ahead of the 2019 elections to abrogate Article 370. It can, but any amendment to the article will not apply to Jammu and Kashmir without the ratification of the state’s legislative assembly.Moreover, in conjunction with Article 370, the presidential order for 1954 provided that no bill to increase or diminish the area of Jammu and Kashmir, or altering its name or the boundaries, can be introduced in Parliament without the consent of the state legislature.It is possible that by keeping the state assembly under suspended animation, the BJP is planning the formation of a government, with certain permutations and combinations in Jammu and Kashmir, which is favourable to such a situation.National Conference leader and former CM Omar Abdullah said on 17 April 2014 that “accession will end if Article 370 is scrapped because the accession is dependent on it”.Senior PDP leader and constitutional lawyer Muzaffar Hussain Beig is of the opinion that the Article 1, under which Jammu and Kashmir is included as a territory of India, has been applied to the state under Article 370 and that if Article 370 goes, Article 1 will automatically cease to apply to the state.Given the slide in the BJP’s popularity and its electoral prospects in 2019, it is possible that the party is contemplating an attempt towards abrogation of Article 370. Such a course would be a disaster for the prospects of durable peace and stability in Jammu & Kashmir. It could also mark an irretrievable trough in the New Delhi-Srinagar relationship.Junaid Mattu
Spokesperson, National ConferenceThe revocation of Article 370 has been and will continue to be the go-to rallying point for the hard-core nationalist narrative, especially ahead of the general elections.This rallying cry doesn’t hinge on constitutional or political realities so the question of the Article’s revocation is purely theoretical – again distorted and supported by half-baked reasoning. The Article apart from being a constitutional chord between the Union and the state is also perhaps the only political basis on which the state builds its rationale for the continued status of its dignified existence within the Union.While I am of the strong belief that the revocation of the Article is beyond the constitutional and legislative reach of the Union, the country’s institutions lately have sprung up many surprises that redefine the probability of such a misadventure. People in Jammu and Kashmir have been weary of such designs since 2013 when the BJP manifesto clearly mentioned the revocation of Article 370 as a cornerstone of its Kashmir policy.This sense of anxiety within the state has been further fuelled by regular statements from senior BJP leaders supporting the revocation. The disillusionment in the Valley has been in part stoked by repeated attempts to distort and villainise the state’s special status as a challenge to the Union’s integrity. Nothing could be farther from the truth. However, this narrative has not allowed constitutionality or the possible implications of such a step in the state to get in its way.Any assault on the remnants of the special status will destroy whatever little credibility Jammu and Kashmir and its institutions have left in the State. Those who believe the revocation of Article 370 will facilitate ‘integration’ are oblivious to the genesis of the turmoil in Kashmir in 1953 – which has manifested itself in recurring periods of conflict.As the state continues to be on the brink after three years of misrule and ideological U-turns, even an indication of a judicial or legislative review of Article 370 could be the tipping point – and this time around the turmoil would be unprecedented.Mehboob Beg
PDP SpokespersonSupreme Court, who is the last word on legal subjects, has delivered a judgment on Article 370, saying the fundamentals of the Indian Constitution can neither be amended and nor can there be any question of revoking it. For me, Article 370 forms the fundamentals of Jammu and Kashmir’s relationship with the Union. And if one starts tampering with the basics, it will open up Pandora’s box. It would mean that one is questioning the relationship itself.The ground situation in Kashmir says loud and clear that people want more federal powers than they have right now. Mehbooba Mufti is right when she says that a muscular policy will not help solve the Kashmir tangle, and we must treat the state as our own.The weakening of Article 370 will weaken the people of Kashmir. Revocation of the article is wishful thinking which cannot happen legally. J&K is the only state which negotiated its relationship with the Union. These legal protections form the basis of such a relationship.One can expect anything from Subramanian Swamy. He is entitled to his will but Article 370 has political undertones. We are proud of being part of a secular, democratic India which gave us certain legal guarantees. We rejected a theocratic state like Pakistan, and that was always an option. Maharaja Hari Singh perhaps didn’t want to join India, but we being Muslims still wanted to join a secular India. Why did Swamy pick on Jammu and Kashmir? He should follow Vajpayee ji’s ideals for peace in the Valley, if not our advice.Apurva Vishwananth
Special Correspondent, ThePrintThe political ground for Article 370 has been shaky under the Modi government and the unease in the state is now at its worst. The government is unlikely to shy away from reviving the debate.Abrogating the provision was in the BJP’s 2014 manifesto. The government initially did try to play mischief by refusing to file affidavits in the Supreme Court and clarifying their position by saying that there is a need for ‘wider’ national discussion on the Article.But a few months later, the PDP-BJP government itself told the court that the permanent stature of Article 370 has been settled. The Supreme Court has indeed, in at least two instances, ruled that Article 370 has attained a permanent status in the Indian Constitution.So, the stumbling block for the Modi government to repeal and amend Article 370 will be a legal one.Article 368, which allows amendments to the Constitution, also does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir unless it is through an order of the President in accordance with Article 370. And, this requires the concurrence of the state government and ratification by the assembly.The conversation on revoking Article 370 will yield political mileage for 2019, but there’s little that the Modi government can do in reality.The Indian government has a constitutional duty to give Kashmir under Article 370 and some other states under Article 371 special treatment. An attempt to alter the provision strikes not just Kashmir but federalism because political sovereignty in India is shared between the union and its states.Compiled by Kritika Banerjee and Divya NarayananThePrint is now on Telegram. For the best reports & opinion on politics, governance and more, subscribe to ThePrint on Telegram.Article 370 exists in both, in GOI Constitution and in JK Assembly Constitution. Any correction or removal must take place signe and sealed by all stake holders. The teouble is the ones who hold JK Assembly powers are 3 to 5 families of long time Muslim heritage who will not make that change and the people of JK will go their representatives sides because they have not seen the fruits of GOI Constitution yet. GOI can not literally buy the JK people’s opinion unless they teach them, bribe them, put them in India with big rewards, and simply hope they will elect only those leaders in JK Assembly who will be proponents of any changes including removal of 370. It’s a catch 22. J. Nehru caused all this to happen. India can physically then, take full control of JK’s electoral process and for some reasons jail these families representatives, and replace them with those who will bring about these changes including removal. Another way is to attack JK and redraft / remove anything GOI does not like. That is called a Civil War.Like all things in life, nothing is permanent, not even the planets let alone the constitutions of India.  They are not set in stones and can never be permanent.  Constitutions are created to facilitate the working of a government and not to obstruct its efficiency.  They are not permanent and the Supreme Court’s opinion that Article 370 has attained a permanent status in the Indian constitution is itself restricted to time and the culture prevailing in a country. If the people of India demand a change in the constitution of India, only an authoritarian government will ignore the democratic will of its majority electorate.  India is a democratic country and it must be governed according to the wishes of its citizens. A nationwide referendum to gauge the views of the majority of Indians with regard to Article 370 will authenticate the true nature of Indian democracy. Any Indian piece of land whether it is in Andaman and Nicobar Islands or in Kashmir belong to all Indians, and not just or exclusively to their local inhabitants. All forms of privileges are unfair, discriminatory and misallocation of resources. Inequality of treatment whether in citizenship, economic opportunities or physical movement is backwardness and against fundamental human rights. The consequence of upholding Article 370 is itself anti-constitutional.Teh experts talk about the consequences, but a plain reading makes it clear that president can do it but not before seeking consent of constituent assembly of jk, which has been abolished in 1957. So first the constituent assembly is to be created to seek consent but that would be mean the abrogation of the accession signed by the then  constituent assembly, a legal herdl.Its abomination to read a senior journalist like Mr Jagannathan casually stating that historical events and facts don’t matter in governing of the nation.Its abomination again to read Mr Jagannathan informing the readers that Article 370 is there in the statute, just to appease “MUSLIMS”.Mr Jagannathan, dose the instrument of accession signed between the Union of India and the sovereign ruler, of J & K, by the way a “HINDU” betray the sentiments expressed by you in your piece?Apurva there was no ruling that happened with respect to Article 370. It was just a observation. So please do not give wrong information and claim you  are a journalist.Save my details",political,0

"Jump to navigationSpeak NowThe Narendra Modi government on Monday moved to dramatically alter the status quo in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government ended days of speculation by making public its decision to effectively revoke the controversial Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.Article 370 accords special status to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag and rights. On Monday morning, home minister Amit Shah rose in Rajya Sabha to announce that the government was moving a Presidential order for Parliament's ratification.The Presidential order used a clause of Article 370 to say that provisions of Article 370 would no longer be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir, a move that essentially revokes the article without actually doing so.In a follow-up, but equally bold move, Amit Shah also said the government was moving a bill to bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories -- Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. While the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir would have a legislature, a la Delhi, Ladakh would not.The Narendra Modi government's historic decision on Jammu and Kashmir, which ranks among the most unprecedented political moves in the country, will be debated for days, even weeks to come. Here is everything you need to know about what happened on Monday.What did the government do today?The government today moved a resolution to effectively abolish Article 370, which gives special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The government also introduced a Bill to divide the state into two Union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh.So Jammu and Kashmir is no longer a state?Short answer: Not yet. The Rajya Sabha has passed the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill which bifurcates the state into two Union territories. The Lok Sabha (where the BJP has a brute majority) now must pass the Bill, which will then go to the President for his assent. Once the President signs the Bill and the government issues a notification, Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be a state.READ | Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh: This is how the redrawn map will look likeBasically:And, what about Article 370? Has it been scrapped?Technically: No. As of now, the government has used a clause within Article 370 to make the provisions of the article inoperative.Let us explain.READ | How govt used Article 370 to kill Article 370What even is Article 370?Article 370 is an enabling provision. It explains which parts of the Indian Constitution have jurisdiction over Jammu and Kashmir, which adopted a separate state constitution for itself during the 1950s.According to it, the Central government needs the concurrence of J&K state government for applying laws. Now that changes.READ | Article 370 has not been scrapped. What does Modi govt move on Kashmir mean?So what happens to Article 35A?Article 35A, making a distinction between the permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir and the outsiders, will also cease to have any effect in Jammu and Kashmir.Why did the government move to revoke the powers of Article 370?Revoking Article 370 of the Constitution has been a key part of the BJP's core agenda and has always struck an emotional chord with its rank and file after its ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee died in a Jammu and Kashmir jail in 1953 to protest the state's special status and demand its complete integration with the Union.Apart from ideology, the Modi government:Has anybody supported the Modi government on its Article 370 move?Yes, apart from NDA allies Shiv Sena, RPI, Akali Dal and others, regional parties like BSP, AAP, BJD, TRS and AIADMK extended full support to the resolution to effectively scrap Article 370 and the Bill to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir. You can read all about that here.How has the Valley reacted to these developments?Since communication in the Valley is currently snapped, there are no first-person reports from the ground.The situation in Kashmir Valley appeared to be ""under control"" as no untoward incident was reported on Monday.However, this can be attributed to the fact authorities have imposed curfew in Kishtwar and Rajouri districts and in the Banihal area of Ramban district, while restrictions were imposed in many districts of Jammu division and Srinagar.NOTE: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, who were under house arrest since Sunday night, have been arrested. Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference leaders Sajjad Lone and Imran Ansari have also been arrested.What is the Opposition saying on these developments related to Jammu and Kashmir?Home Minister Amit Shah's announcement evoked strong protests from the opposition with leaders of Congress, TMC, DMK, NCP and Left raising slogans and storming the well of the House.Some opposition parties termed the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two union territories as a ""black spot"". While Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad Monday said that the state's head, considered as India's crown, has been ""chopped off"" and its identity removed, TMC MP Derek O'Brien said that the Centre was committing ""procedural harakiri"".READ | Today we lost Kashmir: Kapil Sibal accuses govt of evading debate on Article 370Why were all eyes on Amit Shah today?READ | J&K to become state again when the time is right, says Amit ShahSo, what's next for Jammu and Kashmir?Poor, young and illiterate: Why most Indian prisoners fight long lonely battles for justice35 years of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance: Hindutva proposes, rivalry disposesExplained: Will govt’s Rs 25,000 crore help revive ailing real estate sector?Woman finds hidden camera in Pune cafe loo.

							  Last Updated at August 5, 2019 10:08 ISThttps://mybs.in/2X8IafiWith speculation rife that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -led central government could abolish or try to amend Article 35A and article 370, which give a special status to Jammu & Kashmir, there is a lot of confusion as to what these two statutes entail. Political parties on either side of the debate have voiced their opinion, with some calling tinkering with Article 35A “like setting powder keg on fire”, while others have supported the idea calling it a move to unify of the country.What is Article 35A?document.write(""<!--"");if(isUserBanner==""free""&&(displayConBanner==1))document.write(""-->"");googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/6516239/outofpage_1x1_desktop','div-gpt-ad-1490771277198-0').addService(googletag.pubads());googletag.pubads().enableSyncRendering();googletag.enableServices();});

	This provision of the Constitution allows the Jammu & Kashmir state Assembly to define who is and is not a “permanent resident” of the state. To further break it down, this provision of the Constitution gives the legislators from Jammu & Kashmir the exclusive power to determine as to which people in or outside the state will have special rights and privileges granted by the state.

	The provision, inserted through a special Presidential order in 1954, also gives the state Assembly powers to determine the recipients of state grants, the right to purchase land and property in the state, as well as settling permanently in the region. Other than this, the legislative Assembly of Jammu & Kashmir can use the provision to restrict rights of any person not classified under “permanent resident” of the state.

Can Article 35A be amended or repealed?

	The repealing of Article 35A could be a legal uphill task for the central government, experts said. For any changes to be made to the provision, the constituent Assembly of the state has to consent to it. The constituent Assembly of the state, however, ceased to exist in 1957. This, constitutional expert Shubhankar Dam said, made seeking nod from the Assembly impossible.

	“One has to understand where this provision derives its powers from. When it was introduced in 1957, the state constituent Assembly raised the demand, which was then inserted on the recommendation of the President. The clause was introduced due to compromises which the Union had to make at that time. The time and context have to be understood,” said Dam.

	Other experts, however, disagree and say that since there is a valid state legislative Assembly in the state, which also has constituent powers, any changes to Article 35A can be done by it.

What happens if Article 35A is repealed?

	The political ramifications of the decision to repeal Article 35A notwithstanding, there are other legal-regulatory challenges that the government could face if this article were to be repealed. One of the first is that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India as well as the Election Commission would get limited, some experts said.

	Other than repealing, one option before the government is to delete Article 370 altogether, which would then automatically strike off Article 35A. This would, however, mean that the government would have to have a two-thirds majority in both the lower and upper House of Parliament, said Dam.

What is Article 370?

	Article 370, which has been the bone of contention between the state’s politicians and the central BJP leadership, deals with special powers conferred upon the state of Jammu & Kashmir. It allows the state constituent Assembly to make its own Constitution, thereby giving it an “autonomous state” power. After the accession of the state to India in 1947, Article 370 served as a “mechanism for managing Centre-state relations with specific reference to Jammu & Kashmir,” senior journalist, late B G Verghese, had said in his book A J&K Primer.

	Apart from the autonomy, Article 370 also lends other powers such as the need of “concurrence of the state government” if the central government plans to make amendments to the concurrent list of subjects.

Is Article 370 a temporary provision?

	Despite several challenges to the provision on account of it allegedly being a temporary provision, the Supreme Court as well as the high courts have repeatedly upheld that Article 370 is indeed a permanent provision of the Constitution. In a judgment delivered in 2018, the top court said that though the article’s title noted it as ‘temporary’, it was very much of a permanent nature.

	“The issue concerned is covered by the judgment of this court in the 2017 SARFAESI matter, where we have held that despite the headnote of Article 370, it is not a temporary provision,"" a Bench of justices A K Goel and R F Nariman had then said.

Are Article 35A and Article 370 special provisions?

	Despite the popular notion that both Article 35A and Article 370 confer a special-state status to Jammu & Kashmir, most constitutional experts say that there are similar arrangements the Centre has with several other areas.

	“There are similar exceptions in many areas across India. For example, in many states, including Himachal Pradesh, and the Northeast, no one other than those domiciled in these states can purchase land or property. These states do not have the concept of permanent residents,” said Dam.
