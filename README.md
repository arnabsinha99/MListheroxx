This repo is meant for a self progress record. I will keep updating it with the posts, topics and websites I refer to in order to learn new concepts, codes and various other things in the field of Data Science, ML and AI.

### Useful links that I find while studying ML and AI

### Date:- 07/02/2019

* [NIN(Network In Network](http://teleported.in/posts/network-in-network/) 
   
   Had an explanation of MLPConv and Global Average Pooling in it. 
  
* [Implementation of Dropout and it explanation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-regularization-deep-learning-models-keras/   )

   This explains the concept of Dropout Layers, a recent finding, that seems to increase the general performance of Deep Learning models. The 
   basic idea is to drop random nodes in a particular layer so as to generalize the performance of each parameter and not create a bias 
   performance. The following link has the code as well.

* [Convolution NN for Visual Recognition CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#pool)

  This has a complete explanation with Math about the different types of CNN Layers, CNN Architecture and additional references.

* [Softmax Classifier](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/09/12/softmax-classifiers-explained/)

   This explains the difference between Softmax Classifier and the Cross entropy function. Cross entropy function uses the softmax expression
   to evaluate the loss function value. The following link also has the implementation of Softmax classifier. Keras uses a direct function
   for setting the optimizer. 
   
* [Comprehensive Guide to CNN](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53)

   This very neatly and briefly explains about the various layers of a classical CNN and how things work out in one. You might well get a
   beautiful understanding of many of the basic terms in CNN.
